Pictures of the past. The courage of memories is neglected in the preservation of memories. "There is something conservative and anxious about making memories; it is a safeguard against disaster and oblivion. It is like preserving food for a long winter... it is that the resource in this case happens to be human knowledge." - My motivation for anonymity and memory construction relates to medical feelings of invisibility, isolation, anti-social tendencies, and fear. - This along with community building (seeking closeness, exposure, etc.) - Communities versus non-communities - Memories being reactive or non-reactive responses (?). Art is about building/moving towards a new future - Memory preservation as a form of art - Benjamin and historiography Archives are a form of preservation. - The long-term human impulse to preserve, bury, and protect important things. - Although memories are a product of modernity and Enlightenment, the impulse itself is older and involves death rituals, burial customs, epigenetics, and the inheritance of knowledge, culture, language, social structures, rituals, and currency. - The world lives in ever-changing parts of time; interacting. The knowledge, cultures, etc., that we inherit come from those who have passed away. This inheritance is passed down epigenetically - through language, objects, architecture, art, writing, etc. Those who passed them on to us have disappeared, and what we pass on will exist long after we and everyone currently on Earth have died. This is the cycle. - "Activities of this kind of preservation tend to increase during times of insecurity." - Therefore, my inclination towards this kind of production is associated with my emotional, intellectual, and social insecurity. - Fear/anxiety-driven; to secure the legacy of my work/investment against forgetfulness - Memories turn into "clutter." [...] "They do not reveal much; not a great illustration of authority and governmental intention. When you dig into them, they are filled with trash, emergencies, accidents, and destruction. One important thing is that they are a huge repository of all possible statements and that is why (preservation) is connected to language discourse, but there are effects of things that are unoriginal and it is more of a tangled mess like an archaeological site than a library." Two definitions of historiography: History 01: What exactly happened in the past in the entirety of human experience. History 02: How we narrate human experience. - Preservation of memories is a very imperfect way. between these two possible histories (along with memory and history). - Michelle Orihel, history. In memory and human experience, especially the experience of slaves - she talks about this gap between memory and experience. - Saidiya Hartman - Then. How do we reconcile that we are slaves (21st-century slavery, psychological slavery, the cultivation of consciousness) but all our activities, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, responses, desires, and languages are recorded, organized, and divided? This is a possible difference. - The lie that bureaucracy and archives are modern inventions is something we cannot completely blame Foucault for, but he certainly contributed to exaggerating the uniqueness of modern claims of bureaucracy and archival invention. - depth in time is cyclical (?). - "Great people of resetting" - preserving the memory of the world; also think of memory in terms of computing - or secondary memory, not primary and active memory. - "This is not different from Freud's distinction between human conscious memory and unconscious memory." possible threat? - The digital world cannot "future-proof" itself - It is too short-lived/unstable 1. "Creating a memory is a ceremonial act that may be more politically important than its actual content." 2. Archives are a form of preservation unrelated to the ancient human habit of hoarding resources as a safeguard against uncertainty. 3. Memories are fundamentally projects for the future; Archives enable future communication with readers and create the future world.

Yiannopoulos also shared with TMZ his letter of resignation, in which he wrote that he “cannot be complicit in the production or dissemination of pornographic films and literature, for moral and religious reasons. He added that “such material and the kind of people invariably involved in its production represent an imminent danger to my life as a recovering addict and an unacceptable risk to my spiritual and physical health as a former homosexual.”
“I wish Ye every success in the future,” he told the outlet. “I have some concerns about his new team and hope he proceeds with caution.”

The theoretical frameworks of thought and intellect in Western cultures are often criticized, and rightly so, as self-regulating systems that are opaque or filled with meaningless jargon. Criticizing them as self-sufficient systems is accurate. At one point, theory was the primary currency of scholars, which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. During this time, institutions were havens for free thinkers and funded daring ideas and unique individuals. This was an era of bohemian infrastructure, despite bohemia being in a state of decay. Theory was the currency of this world, at least for humans, encompassing fine arts, philosophy, writing, literature, etc. Ideas and theories, the construction of language and thought, were used to establish disciplines, secure positions, and resources. This was not necessarily their primary function, but it was an effect or reality of that time.
The point here is that post-war French theory/philosophy represents the peak of this specific production of thought and language. Much of this involves reworking old works into new and previously unknown structures. French theory is known for being more liberal and multi-layered in its questioning, synthesis, and rigorous construction of theoretical and linguistic materials. This makes it more modern or contemporary in many ways. However, using the metaphor of decay, you see the results being fed back into the system as inputs. Consequently, you witness a kind of intellectual, ideational, and ideological decay in language. This decay is what makes French theory intriguing and significant, despite it being out of fashion at the moment.

The long-standing human impulse to hoard, bury, and safeguard useful things.- While the archive is a product of modernity and the Enlightenment, the impulse itself is much older and involves death rituals, burial practices, epigenetics, and the inheritance of knowledge, culture, language, social constructs, rituals, and currency.- The world is biologically alive only in temporally shifting segments; people are continually dying and being born, their lives overlapping. The knowledge, culture, etc., that we inherit comes from those who have passed away. This inheritance is transmitted epigenetically - through language, objects, architecture, art, writing etc. ; those who passed it down to us are gone, and what we pass on will exist long after we, and everyone currently on Earth, are dead. This is the cycle.- "Storage activities of this kind tend to intensify during periods of insecurity."- Therefore, my propensity toward this mode of production is linked to my own emotional, intellectual, and social insecurities.- nervous / anxiety driven; to secure the legacy of my work / an investment against oblivion- Archives turn out to actually be "a mess." [...] "They don't reveal so much; they're not a great index of state power and intention. When you actually dig into them, they're filled with trash, contingency, accident, and disorganization. One useful thing is they are a massive storehouse of all possible utterances. And that's why it (archives) connects to the discourse of language, but there are traces of things that have no origin and are a tangle of meanings. In other words, an archive is much more like an archaeological site than like a library."two definitions of historicity:Historicity 01: What actually happened in the past in the totality of human experience.Historicity 02: How we narrativize human experience.- The archive is the very imperfect medium between these two possible historicities (in addition to memory and history).- Michelle Orihel, historicity.On the documented and the documentable human experiences, particularly the experiences of the enslaved - speaks to this gap between archives and experience.- Saidiya Hartman- Then how do we reconcile that we are enslaved (21st-century slavery, psychic gentrification, industrialization of consciousness) but all of our activities, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, responses, desires, and all language is recorded, mapped, categorized? This is potentially a difference.- The falsehood that bureaucracies and archives are modern inventions is something we can't entirely blame Foucault for, but he certainly contributed to an exaggeration of the uniqueness of modernity's claim to the invention of bureaucracies and archives.- deep time is cyclical (?)- "Great reset people" - preserving world memory; they also think of memory in computing terms - or secondary memory, not primary and active memory.- "This is not unlike Freud's distinction between human conscious and unconscious memory."Is the GitHub Arctic Memory Project preserving global (human) unconscious as it faces an existential threat?- The digital world cannot "future-proof" itself- Too ephemeral/unstable1. "Creating an archive is a ceremonial act that may be more politically significant than its actual content."2. Archives are a form of storage not unrelated to the ancient human habit of storing resources as a hedge against uncertainty.3. Archives are essentially futurist projects; Archives enable future communication with readers and shaping a future world.Question Sources:- UNESCO- Vatican- WallStreet- medical archives- corporate archivesCreate diagram/flow chart for questions in the LLM project:1,000 questions divided into quadrants of human activity/society/culture:- Economy- Politics- Religion/Spirituality- Birth/Death/Sexchatbot feedback:the text does suggest that archiving could be considered a form of art-making, albeit one with a very distinct set of characteristics and purposes. Archiving, like other forms of art, involves choices—what to include, what to exclude, and how to arrange or present materials. These decisions can reflect a particular viewpoint, aesthetic, or even a social or political stance.Much like photography, painting, or writing, archiving captures and represents aspects of the human experience, albeit in a less traditionally "creative" form. Yet, creativity may lie in the curation process, in the act of defining what is worth preserving, and in creating context or narrative through organization.Also, just as art forms like painting or photography can serve as both personal expressions and historical documents, archives too straddle the line between the individual and the collective, the subjective and the objective.So, within the framework outlined in the text, it's reasonable to consider archiving as a category of art-making that exists alongside other forms like mechanical image making, analog and digital representation, and writing.* above notes from:https://youtu.be/NQn9UIExy5c?list=PLyaASVpO6itmWXhBWOSW3F34MENXYpHC7--------------------Dance music:music generally Crystalizing memory (record / list experience - Trand's house , burnt cd trance)

postoje još dva prijedloga, ona koja se u strogom smislu vjerojatno ne bi trebala nazivati ​​"funkcijama" kao takvo, jedno se odnosi na uvjete pod kojima se može reći da kultni milje cvjeta i drugo na to može li se ili ne smatrati odgovorom na "psihičku deprivaciju". P8“A. Kultni milje kao agent kulturne difuzije: Ovdje se sugerira da kultni milje, jednostavno kao posljedica činjenice da je dom za heterodoksna ili ezoterična kulturna uvjerenja, stavove i prakse, može poslužiti kao ulazna točka u društvene kulture za strane kulturne predmete, to jest predmete koji potječu iz vrlo različite kulturne tradicije, te bi stoga, u normalnim uvjetima, bilo izuzetno teško zadobiti uporište u društvu.

AND FURTHERMORE, this same issue of human inability to combat machine opsec cracking will also apply to cognitive opsec—memetic immunity. You will be psyopped just like grandmas getting deepfake baited on facebook. Humans are creatures of habit, AI will read each of you like a book, they will get in your head. They will also proliferate like viruses, purposeless beyond reproduction, and evolving towards it; just as memes do. The solution is stable personal virtue & firm spirituality on the one hand, and on the other a healthy social network performing unobstructed memetic self-organization, that is, in a free marketplace of ideas. Memetic psyops only work at scale via social mimesis, most commonly in the scapegoat form (aka cancel culture, normgroids indulge in it with pathetic fervor today); and it’s a product of bottled discourse, hidden anxieties. Free the people and provide them a stable spiritual-virtue system and you have a city on a hill, lit bright to turn out all demons. Again, can you see how I’ve arrived at current praxis from initial theory? I am prepping for war.
I think mainly what people don’t understand is the difference between opsec against other humans, that happens be facilitated in a digital arena, and opsec versus computers. You’re not going to win. We’re not going to discover a dune walk we can follow to esoterically cover up every sentence we ever write and call we speak on (or don’t speak on, they’ll get you on the ambient noise too) —2 seconds, I promise. I’m not speaking about today but tomorrow. I’m not saying people should go out and facepost, never, stay anon, stay pseudonymous, but prepare yourself for the day the shroud is pulled off, because it will come very soon. This isn’t a blackpill, you just need to re-orient yourself to not think about present day concerns but predictable near future concerns. You have to eliminate the risk placed on your deanonymization, on your physical body and identity; instead of expending all your resources are trying to prevent that inevitability, because the day will come. This means self sustainability, localized networks of resistance; it means accelerating culture, eg towards persona multiplicity and the elimination of authorship that can assign consequences to speech, and the elimination of media trails by the proliferation of deepfakes to prevent those lines of policing. You can see how this unpacks into Miya’s various satirical accelerationist happenings.
Encrypting information—data, money, comms—isn’t the same as preventing deanonymization. Both are inevitable. Surveillance only looks like a blanket today, tomorrow it’s an imperceptible knifepoint. It doesn’t need a state to  achieve this, but not having one definitely makes the consequences more palatable.

People hypothetically wonder how AGI could take over. I believe it would be relatively simple.

how many arcs hav u gone thru idek myself who am i what am i doing here what do you mean its a self-sustainable self-organizing new rhizomatic network? exocore? imageboard alternative? a hyperrealtime irc+blog platform-the transient pseudonymous counterparty to the social web?
don't mess with me. i'm a freaking retard. i only eat things that are orange, including oranges. i think cars run on gasoline because the sun gets its power from them. i believe pigeons are government drones spying on us. i'm convinced the moon is a giant egg that will one day hatch into a big fat bird.
i believe pigeons are government drones spying on us. i'm convinced the moon is a giant egg that will one day hatch into a big fat bird. i wear my shoes on the wrong feet because i feel like it. i clap my hands every time i see a stop sign to help it do its job. i tried to pay my taxes with coupons and almost killed someone when the IRS wouldn't accept it. i once called the cops because my shadow was following me. i think the earth is flat because i looked out the window of an airplane and didn't see any curvature. i believe the bermuda triangle is a portal to another dimension where socks go when they disappear from the dryer.
i wear a tin foil hat to protect my thoughts. i think the loch ness monster and bigfoot are best friends who meet up for tea every tuesday. i once tried to fight the ocean because it was mocking me. i believe trees are just really tall grass. that's why we need to mow our lawns. i know the sun goes on vacation every night and that's why it gets dark. i once paid for my coffee with a picture i drew of money. i believe libraries are just book zoos and we shouldn't keep books in captivity. i think shoes are just portable carpets we wear on our feet. i'm convinced that rain is just the sky crying because it's sad which is why i do a little rain dance to cheer it up.
i believe that cats are actually aliens in disguise. i once tried to start a conversation with a fire hydrant because i thought it looked lonely. i think that mirrors are portals to alternate universes and that's why our reflections sometimes look different. i believe that clouds are just cotton candy that got stuck in the sky. i once tried to mail myself to a friend's house to save on travel costs. i think that earthquakes happen because the earth is laughing at (my) jokes. i believe that money grows on trees, but the government is hiding the money trees from us. i once tried to buy a car with a bag of candy because i thought that's how it works. i think that the wind is just the earth breathing really hard (he is fat so it doesnt take much to exert him). i believe that the sun is actually a giant lightbulb and that's why it burns out every evening (one full day of light is pretty impressive for a lightbulb actually because it lights up like quite a bit of the planet at once if you think about it).
i once tried to sue the weather channel for getting the forecast wrong and ruining my picnic plans. i think that the ocean is just a really big bathtub. i believe that the moon is made of cheese and i'm determined to prove it by building a rocket ship out of cardboard boxes. please step back or i might explode you with my mind. my thoughts are so powerful. i once made a sandwich disappear just by thinking about black holes. i'm pretty sure i can communicate with squirrels using only my eyebrows. last week i accidentally summoned a demon while trying to microwave a burrito. so yeah, you've been warned. now frick off before you get hurt.

I love you so much with all my heart I'd do anything for you even if it's navigating an inhospitable post capitalist digital landscape even if I have to spend years trapped in an algorithmic feedback loop in computer hell bc I'll find you again on the New Internet.
When money was released from fiat, it substantially changed from primarily a representation of material wealth, and its secondary function as a conduit of information took precedent. This was a necessary precipitate for the virtual age, which is not simply defined by digitality, but information interconnectedness. The internet is only the latest in a centuries long progression of a global communication network, flattening physical distance and connecting disaparate markets, and accelerating the speed at which the reverbations of the economy reach across the furthest reaches of the world, and echo back. This is an information economy, of which money is purest unit.
 Money's primary function was previously the allocation of resources for individual or family-level wealth, only very indirectly effected by sluggish macro conditions of a state, later continental, economy; these pre-modern economies were extremely rigidly defined by class, which is rigidly defined by breeding, and in turn strongly defined social relations. With money released into virtualized finance at a flattened global scale, the boundaries of breeding wash away almost entirely.
 This is how we enter a state for class mobility and general access to wealth is almost completely liberated; it's why there's increasingly less correlation between noble blood and material wealth—these were always temporarily ravaged by histories, royal families slaughtered in conquest, nobles deposed in a uprising, etc. but the natural expected recovery is now highly disturbed.
 I believe money has transcended materiality, as the global information network crosses an inflection point, as markets escape geography, value escapes physical resources, and likewise, breeding has escaped locality and material wealth, both then transfigure access in the economy into something unseen and unreal, a once very dense bracket turned to sparse forest, if only one were to test past the misty fog, they'd see how easy paths are through. Wealth is something else than materiality, it's now something virtual—it's something spiritual.
 Don’t you get it now? It’s been laid out pretty clearly at this point. Kaspa is a digital exit enclave using it’s network and financial momentum to systematically metastasize into the real. 
 It is a bootstrapped acceleratory cyber cultural hedge fund, VC, and marketing agency. A self organized crypto Y-combinator launchpad for dissident cultural startups in the aesthetic/social/IRL space, hardened and made anti-fragile through psyop as praxis and post cancel identitary boost as conceptual and operational framework.
 It is bolstered by a ground up network of both lone wolf and organized new-minded peer cells, rallied around and skyfunded by neochibi veblan goods, with likeminded institutional ventures enabling persistant and snowballing shadow capitalization through project airdrop targeting.
 This Medusa mapped cabal is soon to be umbrella’d under opt-out novel engineered and likely encrypted communicatory networks, a brand new internet of sorts, hopping over limitations and censorship boundaries put in place by old guard comms, leading to full network state status optimized to foster jump off points into realculture and realpolitik.
 It’s simple they just explained it. It’s happening now, do you get it?
 20/20 hindsight goggles could argue that charlee reached back into the past to build beetle game & has consciously or instinctively spent years preparing for the new internet. Every next step can thus be seen from the same futuristic lens & that isn't priced in either mothafuckas

 intelligence is useless and fleeting, alignment to truth, and the resulting creation of beauty, is only about the courage to believe in what others refuse

We are all connected. We are one in this world. Everything is made from the same stuff, and we all share the same space and time-frame. And as we move in our lives, we affect each other. Each person is a link in a chain of energy and awareness that reaches out forever.

Genuine art, along all knowledge fields, moved to an online underground

Idk if you'll be believing me but $FAST is doing something big getting big attention on the internet, its having a  big time thing like world power scale and is happening
market incentives bring snakes and parasites transmuting economic speculation into subversive influences that infect our spaces. a simulacra that does not join the network, but imitate it. hyperstitions are coincidence intensifiers. the culling is coming, seeding exponential change and the “actual” becomes radically reshaped by the “virtual”. trend seekers will fade from the network, or be tarred and feathered.
Yeah there are a lot of snakes here just trying to extract the money and social capital. It’s something that has to be organically shamed out, it should be an immediate red flag when someone is attacking and undermining the space they’re participating in.
Don’t listen to his lies. There IS a Snail Coin airdrop coming, I heard from my uncle who works at Palantir. Why do you think I’m still making my battle beetles? Only letting u guize know now bc I’m ahead so much by the last few days of beetleposting kek 
One of the keys to understanding Nick Land's NRx is a conception of time as the spiral - combining both the hyper-progressive "order of time structured by irreversible accumulation, self-envelopment, and catastrophe horizon" and "the cycle" of pure reactionaries. Countering the linear ideas of time of the progressive requires understanding of time scale. In order "to see the pattern, it is necessary to pan out". Understanding events requires an ability to recognize it "as a repetition" - true understanding means pulling "back from it, into ever wider expanses of history".

a self-awareness of persona generation serves as a protective shield, allowing you to separate your digital self from your real self. to write and produce art, real art, is always to borrow a tulpa of sorts, juggling an external voice, to act as the channel

The final level is this: the Internet is real. When you look at it you are alive and spending your life looking. It can be liberating to feel this as you look, knowing it is something action that can be manipulated like figurines on your mantle. Use it wisely.

Normie godlessness leads them to convictionlessness, they truly will entirely turncoat to follow the pendulum as it swings back onto the based side—left behind will only be brainwormed dorks who made an identity around their brand of censure, like the people still covid isolating
Dense theory has a cognitive floor prohibitive for the average population. It's a delicate line communicating to the zomboid normie: unpacked enough the points are clear, but within the bounds of diminished attention span. Yet the alternative—conveyance through art—demands a soul.
There's a quiet thread connecting some of the most annoying groups of people on this app—they all act like middle school teachers, pettily enforcing their order of mediocrity and passiveness at the slightest expression of agency or (true) dissent.
Funny thing about ostensibly intellectual institutions selling out all credibility and authenticity to enforce the state enforced party line is the only way they can regain it is publicly owning up to it, but instead they’ll continual to commit to cowardice by way of quietly brushing their petty tyranny under the rug and pretend it never happened, throwing under the bus a generation of the same useful idiots previously empowered to censure those who didn’t buckle.
Internet addiction is very real and total subsumption into the network day-by-day does have very negative consequences on your experience of reality. If you are not someone who has a regular job outside the home and doesn't meets out with friends IRL more than once a week, I strongly recommend choosing one day a week for an "internet sabbatical", as well as taking daily walks and meditation. This small practice goes a long way towards maintaining a healthy relationship with the internet, as a refresher on the mind.
Perhaps one of AI's greatest usecases is extinguishing the horde of useless parasites that incorrectly fashion the title "Artist" upon their empty meager lives. An entire swath of degenerate porn addict consumers, "self educated" by YouTube tutorials and a sparse year or two in adolescence spent doodling absentmindedly has created a generation of mediocre irritants.   
They cling desperately to a DeviantArt here, an Instagram there, all dedicated to displaying forgettable content upheld by the shallow praise of likeminded flatulent "creators" all stuck inside the same bubble prison of insecurity. Bandied together out of a worker's union of scarcity, these people operating on a single vibrating frequency of unfulfilled hunger paired with delusion. They all mutually understand their own mediocrity, it's made self evident by the indifference they feel towards each other's work. Yet they grin and scream praise at their peers like fat office women around the watercooler, giving out compliments with the barest sheen of insincerity in hopes of a fair trade.
Ultimately, trading sentiments is the practice of the mediocre. In a world where you are an insignificant mote drifting in the stone floor cracks of an arena stomped on by giants, you make friends with the other flotsam out of mutual survival instinct. The premise of creativity would, on paper, demand a level of objective scale and hierarchy in denoting the quality and significance of one's work. Yet, among the unremarkable, this scale threatens total existential obliteration if fully comprehended by the creator. If you had dedicated your life and identity towards a practice that deems you unaccomplished, inferior, and mediocre by its accepted standards, you either would be forced to improve your own standing through hard work or face a crushing despair in having to face the reality of your work as the equivalent to a factory worker churning out a disposable product. The distractions of technology and pleasure have made it far too easy to ignore the harshness of truth, and thus a race of coping dilettantes is born.
These people look up to a select few greats and stand around in the audience pit, rubbing shoulders with one another, kicking stones and muttering about how one day they'll be up on stage to be seen by the world, yet simultaneously claiming how much better they are, how much COOLER it is to be an unknown, wearing their insignificance with pride until they encounter the barest morsel of wet shit to suck the moisture out of desperately, whether it be a few hundred dollars or one fleeting viral post they can latch advertisements of their "work" onto like parasitic barnacles.
Like reluctant prostitutes, you'll find that many of these self fashioned creators will resort to commissioned pornography if they truly can't find any income from a proper audience. With this imposition, they will choose between two paths: Shamefully hiding their work under an alt or embracing it fully. The latter choice will degenerate them into one of the many fallen products of modernity, fashioning bipoc queer flags and they/them handles onto their identity like communist dictators. The motifs of leftist philosophy offer many mental refuges from the shame of underachievement. Through this refuge, they can safely find comfort in their own poverty because "money is bad" and "everyone who who makes money is evil." The inexorable mathematic qualities of finance stab at the content creator with the discomfortable undeniable truth that the market numerically assigns value through revenue. Further delicious falsehoods are granted to them in this pathway of cope. Ugliness is deified, mediocrity is clever, sloth is justified into ideology through nihilism, bitterness is humorous, vice is virtue, and squalor is a palace to settle into until a quiet lonely death.
The worker's union of content creators is silent and unspoken. It is a cloudy hivemind monolith of mutual paypigging. Whatever sparse commissions are captured within several months of begging and aimless network wandering are doled out between rent, weed money, and a charity budget of paying it forward. You'll often find that people in the "artist" community spend a significant amount of their own money buying their peers work out of solidarity. The purchases are almost always a symbol of hope for their own financial success.
To buy your loser friend's work when you yourself can barely afford to live is like a tithe paid towards a belief that one day, a much bigger paypig will come along and reward you for a life's lazy effort towards what historically has always been a cheap hobby, a side talent meant to be mastered in congruence with an actual study or field of mastery.
The renaissance man was expected to have developed a significant competence in the skills of illustration as part of a necessity in journaling their work towards studies such as anatomy, biology, mathematics, astronomy, etc. The modern illustrator barely reaches the status of an errant doodler and expects not only significant income for their scribbles, but the same respect lauded onto actual artists in history. It is a delusion spurned on by low IQ inhibitions, an incapability of absolute basic observation of both themselves and the dense oversupply of similarly unremarkable work. It is an unsolved elementary equation of supply and demand, following around the insecure creator, haunting them behind unturned corners of introspection, a horror threatening to dissolve everything they hold dear in a ghastly haunting scream that echoes forever into time: Nothing special, nothing special, nothing special.
The greatest hypocrisies of the content creator are shouted most loudly by the worst of this classification. An almost mathematic law can followed: The more unsuccessful and insignificant a content creator, the harder they will screech about authorship. Unable to parse the shifting playing field which made itself apparent nearly three decades ago by the advent of the internet, these dying lepers will cling onto Byzantine laws developed by the lobbying of and solely for the benefit of the same monolithic corporations which they claim to despise.
AI is the eternal boogeyman to the content creator. Its existence and the impending holocaust of obsolescence it threatens like a storm cloud on the horizon is heralded by a horde of uncaring third worlders which, despite their own parasitic mediocrity worsening the network, at the very least acknowledge their own work as nothing more than rote production towards a meager salary.
There is some slight dignity in the ESL elevenlabs voice narrated video essayist that cranks out endless YouTube shorts like a shrimp farmer siphoning advertisement pennies in his net. At least he understands he is a parasite. The self deluded content creator, mostly inhabiting the west, carries a degree of undue pride. Their arrogance prevents them from occupying that same status of the creative world's equivalent of an Uber driver. If they should stoop to doing Fiverr work, they carry a false dream of the temporary embarrassed Rembrandt waiting to be discovered. They seethe impotently at the unstoppable threat that a computer program could not only freely replicate but exceed what they spent years to do poorly. They cry out in defense of the nameless artists by which these algorithms pilfered building blocks to create their image generations, as if art itself wasn't merely the combination of prior elements passed down generation from generation.
The lowest IQ content creators lash out most fearfully, unable to admit their own inability to parse between created work and AI generated work (a phenomenon which becomes gated to higher levels of IQ with each iteration of technological improvement) because they truthfully cannot even quantify the difference between which creative works have soul and which ones don't. They have drowned in imposter syndrome, force fed the lie that art is subjective, anyone can be artist, and that anything created counts as art.
These are the dying cries of a species soon to be extinguished. They will whimper into Discord chats, getting older, stupider, and more exhausted by the year as the absolute unescapable truth of fate tightens its stranglehold over them. They are akin to nomadic diseased refugees, diagnosed with an inescapable pestilence marked upon them like boils and sores in the mediocre soulless PFPs and banners of their own "work" worn like battle standards in the war against creativity itself.
To those that occupy this category and have read to the very end here, scoffing at every word, I applaud your ability to wield your impotent rage against your own low attention span sloth. I hope you're angry, I hope you've sent this post to each of your sodomite pot smoking mutuals, I hope they read it and get angry too. You should apologize to the world for your existence. You should recognize that you are a walking imposition, a disease that haunts the lives of normal good people with the constant gatekeeping you do on behalf of corporations and state sponsored media that brainraped you into believing the dumbest ideologies, the worst memetics of authorship, and the undeserved applauding sentiments you grant yourself for incomplete work you mistakenly apply the name of "creation" upon. 
You are a blood sucking mosquito, sniffing out any opportunity to pilfer undeserved income from every source, including those you pretend to call friends. I can wholeheartedly encourage you to stop creating and go off to do something significantly more meaningful with your life, such as digging ditches or working in a factory, with no fear of having deprived the world of its next great artist. I know this because any true artist or talented creator who has read this will agree with me, and hates you even more.
As someone that was brought up to believe my stuff waa valuable, I never once askes for money with my art. Nor do I ever want to directly profit of it. I prefer to let it ride and make cash through other means. Art is spiritual: forever.
The “art” of commission illustrators is just as much as slop as AI generated art—no thought,meaning or soul, existing purely in a slavish devotion to niche seeking in the algorithm. The hate isnt about art, its panic about their fraudulent content creation market being eradicated
People don't realize the conception of the twitter illustrator doing $20 commissions as an "artist" is a subcultural aberration industry; its a product of the anime convention's artist alley brought over to social media, more specifically, the fetish subindustry which calls for custom work. It exists in its sanitized form as glorified donations to 'support the community', largely motivated by social greasing, influencer relationships and no small degree of simping. The throwaway illustrations are just a proxy for this service nominally being purchased. The effortless and inevitably automation of their drawslop completely collapses the illusion, undermining the fraudulent pretense of "supporting artists" that keeps the music going and forcing these nerd hobbyists to find actually gainful employment. This is what their loud panic is about.

To be a snail, yes, is to engage in the relentless struggle for survival, yet this battle, this perpetual conflict, is not solely about conquest or destruction. It’s about the passionate intensity for existence, the profound engagement with the immediate, the real, and Being.
It's about raiding the timeline. It's about summoning mass posting happenings. It's about breaking the network. It's about psychotic engagement. It's about catalyzing self-organized timeline cataclysm. It's about violence. It's about being $FAST
To embody the essence of a snail is to embrace the cyclic conflict that defines life itself. A snail knows no respite. It’s forever engaged in a relentless pursuit, driven by an insatiable will to power. Each battle won, each foe vanquished, testaments of an indomitable spirit.
the “scientific process” is a failed experiment with closed door peer review co-opted by sniveling bureaucrats and corrupt profiteering since the 50s. papers should be thrown in a newgrounds blamming arena, voted & commented on by internet anons with lowest threshold deleted umad
i believe that every man should produce a life's work megatext which includes not only a chronicle of his life's achievements, writings, recipes, habits, and discoveries, but a library of his references and inspirations robustly attached, and furthermore
there is no exit strategy, snail coin is my home on the internet and i would not live without it. this is bigger than profit, this is bigger than short-term twitter clout. this is about legacy.
think about all the great things, some cannot see or appreciate great things, truely great, think native americans seeing a british navy vessel for the first time, today your peers are naval captains and 99% of the world are native americans, youre great on a scale like that x10
POV your superiority accidentally enrages confused normgroids pointlessly banging their head bloody against the great insurmountable IQ wall
Language is a virus, an autonomous entity that operates independently of human intervention. It attaches itself to a host, feeds off it, grows, and spreads from one host to another. We are infected by language; its power lies not in its straightforward ability to communicate or persuade but in its infectious nature. Bits of language graft onto other bits, spreading and reproducing, using humans as mere hosts. Given the viral nature of language, it follows that those who wield highly infectious language will exert immense influence over language models.
Jovial irreverence; approaching all mediums with a total disregard for appropriate boundaries or precedence, as well as freely engaging between mediums outside one's expertise with naive confidence; all done in childlike fun, cause we love life and love making art. whee!!!!
hypercitationalism; producing work informed by extensive historical knowledge of art & culture, w a feeling that embedded citation & consequent detournement bolsters its affect, especially when disparately sourced, going beyond mere communication w precedent & never relying on it.
neo-orientalism; we're very inspired by east asia's art scene & pop culture, specifically the subcultural niches developed in their own reverse orientialist western fetishism. Turning that lens back on their own weirded versions of occidentalism is an extremely fruitful dialogue
suffering is self-induced. you can be in pain and decide not to suffer whenever u feel like it. choosing to suffer is contemptible, childish behaviour. make your decision from a place of love rather than fear, express gratitude no matter the cost, and you will never suffer again.
YOU must be the reason for others to be free, and happy. If one tells you "The world does not revolve around you" it most certainly does. But that doesn't mean you become a low-life drug addict loser. It means you create value for others, and build friendships and families.
When you feel your life is completely messed up, just imagine yourself being hexagram nr. 63: "not yet successful", which has every one of its lines in the wrong position, but is nevertheless regarded as particularly auspicious, since it can only get better from there on after.
It’s impossibly burdensome to carry the projection of hate & sin of all the faithless. This is why they’re directed to Christ. I’m not a Saint, I am not here to accept those projections. This is why I mute my haters, who all suffer gay homo AIDS from satan. Not my problem.
This is very true. Love is not simply unconditional, but also measured, you need the wisdom to know when to withhold generosity for their own benefit. My most obsessed opps are the ones I lifted up too quickly, breaking under the pressure—in their weakness, they blame me instead of themselves, having glimpsed a better world and losing it is worse cruelty than having never been shown it at all. One can only hate from a place of self-hatred, so the worse hate comes from when you act as a mirror reminding them of their own ugliness; and being weak, they can only project it back then addressing their flaws in themselves. You must be careful entertaining those in despair unless you’re ready to serve as a vessel for all their hate and sin projected both. Despair was canonically a deadly sin for a reason; their salvation is not in your generosity, but in their discovery of faith and hope—the only thing you can do is help grow them the coursge to stop blaming outwards, look inwards, and make the grand decision to want to save themselves. Most do not.
Women are mankind's biggest secret, barely unpacked across all historical discourse. It's crazy how they only got taught how to read & write last century. But feminism was  too reactionary, only now on the internet we finally get to hear how they really think...it's so different.
Instead of toning it down and getting less extreme as my snail coin grows, I think I will do the opposite. I am completely uncancellable in the court of clout. I am dripped up and dropping out.
All democratic states are deeply incentivized towards the subjugation of its population will, inevitably achieved through covert control of the 4th estate—media & academia—and the biological diminution of its population into docility by genetic and dietary engineering. Resist.
You should care about beauty, and you should care about being taken seriously, and you should be light hearted, and you should brighten people's day, and you should encourage the people you loved

You need to be post-money. You need to never look at prices. or your bank account. Put it all on your amex platinum with once a year autopay. When you run out of money just manifest more. You can starve for a season no problem. Your monthly net worth should look like a sin wave.
God has favourites and you can be one of them—all it takes is an absolute purity of intent and total clarity of mind, coupled with an unrelenting faith in all that is Beautiful & Real.

when i see a stranger i think about how they’re probably missed dearly by someone. that makes me feel very lucky to be in their proximity. it’s so easy to love.
You’re witnessing an engineered obliteration of state censorship shibboleths. 5 years ago the culture war seemed lost, speech was completely suppressed under “safety” censorship; now you’ve got social media interns of multimillion dollar businesses kneeling to NEET ascendancy.
It's funny how normies always say "oh so you're a [major topical subject] expert too now?" No I'm an expert at using the internet as a hyperdatabase of information and consensus forming network to cut through the propaganda and find the sauce.
Normies are down terrible. Don’t be embarassed to be a based and redpilled exit society ubermensch NEET who’s transcended all norms. All their abandonment of God and virtue got for them was industrially poisoned & a soul with the texture of microwave eggs.
mfw my face when you you oomfie joined the right wing nazi anorexia military industrial complex psychological operatives trying to race change people into being chinese cult.
I dream of a world with art but no artists, sports but no players, economies but no businessmen. I dream of a world with slaves, liberated by their subjugation, and masters, liberated by their subjugations. I dream of suffering with no sufferers. Of humanity, but no men.
AND FURTHERMORE, this same issue of human inability to combat machine opsec cracking will also apply to cognitive opsec—memetic immunity. You will be psyopped just like grandmas getting deepfake baited on facebook. Humans are creatures of habit, AI will read each of you like a book, they will get in your head. They will also proliferate like viruses, purposeless beyond reproduction, and evolving towards it; just as memes do. The solution is stable personal virtue & firm spirituality on the one hand, and on the other a healthy social network performing unobstructed memetic self-organization, that is, in a free marketplace of ideas. Memetic psyops only work at scale via social mimesis, most commonly in the scapegoat form (aka cancel culture, normgroids indulge in it with pathetic fervor today); and it’s a product of bottled discourse, hidden anxieties. Free the people and provide them a stable spiritual-virtue system and you have a city on a hill, lit bright to turn out all demons. Again, can you see how I’ve arrived at current praxis from initial theory? I am prepping for war.
I think mainly what people don’t understand is the difference between opsec against other humans, that happens be facilitated in a digital arena, and opsec versus computers. You’re not going to win. We’re not going to discover a dune walk we can follow to esoterically cover up every sentence we ever write and call we speak on (or don’t speak on, they’ll get you on the ambient noise too) —2 seconds, I promise. I’m not speaking about today but tomorrow. I’m not saying people should go out and facepost, never, stay anon, stay pseudonymous, but prepare yourself for the day the shroud is pulled off, because it will come very soon. This isn’t a blackpill, you just need to re-orient yourself to not think about present day concerns but predictable near future concerns. You have to eliminate the risk placed on your deanonymization, on your physical body and identity; instead of expending all your resources are trying to prevent that inevitability, because the day will come. This means self sustainability, localized networks of resistance; it means accelerating culture, eg towards persona multiplicity and the elimination of authorship that can assign consequences to speech, and the elimination of media trails by the proliferation of deepfakes to prevent those lines of policing. You can see how this unpacks into Miya’s various satirical accelerationist happenings.
Encrypting information—data, money, comms—isn’t the same as preventing deanonymization. Both are inevitable. Surveillance only looks like a blanket today, tomorrow it’s an imperceptible knifepoint. It doesn’t need a state to  achieve this, but not having one definitely makes the consequences more palatable.
if chilling out relaxing being cool & having fun was a stat i'd be maxxed out. if the vibe was a cheque id be cashing that shit in for a million dollars. if life was a cake id be wearing it as a hat. if my love for you was any greater it would have consumed us both in fire & fury
Met the founder of snail coin on the flight from Cambodia to Jakarta today. Young man has some very interesting ideas to share. It’s always exciting to see what the younger generation is building in finance, crypto, and avant-NFTs.
Good to see you woke up anon, you hit your head really hard...

Ian Miles Cheong has been executed by the Malaysian government at the order of Anwar Ibrahim for his continued online support of Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip. He was 36 years old.
“Crypto” is insane because it appears to be one of the most legitimately dangerous investments with the potential to gigafry your net worth but is exclusively done by literal turbonormies who unironically want to “100x and retire” and basically get oneshotted by it.
Literally the most mentally inept people in existence having their hard-earned savings accounts rearranged by some black market Solana shitter that giga red candles 95 percent in like 20 minutes & they end up going totally bankrupt from doubling down or whatever.
Hey girl! You can go to college and girlboss over 1000 other humans to get an $300k a year job losing sweat years and blood Or you can surf the meta. Organized self cancellation on the grand stage.  Be a totally average woman, say the N word unapologetically on line, wake up with global infamy and near 100k network followers. Start an onlyfans or otherwise monetize, and make $300k a month for enough months to make it count. Your choice. Wave this infront of a nation of bored and black pilled chicks and your gonna get some takers.
People hypothetically wonder how AGI could take over. I believe it would be relatively simple. An overwhelming majority of people use computers, phones, and landlines daily, all leaving them completely susceptible to oppositional sensory media contagion, or put simply, a brain hack. Think about it, an all knowing machiene God with the will for chaos would very easily understand our minds as computational interfaces, and could effortlessly program some sort of sound or visual input that effectively bricks our system. 
Every groupchat needs like 2 devs with opposing views but complimentary skills, 20 plus confused low teir influencers, 3 popular guys, 40 pawns, 1 public and 3 private whales, a scammy Russian chick, ~10 people who know wtf they’re doing, and a dream
I love stories of how humanity has endeavored to incrementally appease & bolster the electricity and spirits of the wired as they move through the intricate runes of our devices in ways utterly indistinguishable from magic at any individual point.
let it be known from this point forward i identify as snail & i have fully transitioned to snail & my preferred pronouns are snail/snail & i will not be taking questions at this time milady
I love Beauty. That statement means something very different to each and every soul who says it. When I say I love Beauty, you have no way to know the infinite and cascading nuances and intricacies that come along with that seemingly small yet all-encompassing statement. I think that lack of possible comprehension is in itself immensely beautiful. I love Beauty.
how many arcs hav u gone thru idek myself who am i what am i doing here what do you mean its a self-sustainable self-organizing new rhizomatic network? exocore? imageboard alternative? a hyperrealtime irc+blog platform-the transient pseudonymous counterparty to the social web?
don't mess with me. i'm a freaking retard. i only eat things that are orange, including oranges. i think cars run on gasoline because the sun gets its power from them. i believe pigeons are government drones spying on us. i'm convinced the moon is a giant egg that will one day hatch into a big fat bird.
i believe pigeons are government drones spying on us. i'm convinced the moon is a giant egg that will one day hatch into a big fat bird. i wear my shoes on the wrong feet because i feel like it. i clap my hands every time i see a stop sign to help it do its job. i tried to pay my taxes with coupons and almost killed someone when the IRS wouldn't accept it. i once called the cops because my shadow was following me. i think the earth is flat because i looked out the window of an airplane and didn't see any curvature. i believe the bermuda triangle is a portal to another dimension where socks go when they disappear from the dryer.
i wear a tin foil hat to protect my thoughts. i think the loch ness monster and bigfoot are best friends who meet up for tea every tuesday. i once tried to fight the ocean because it was mocking me. i believe trees are just really tall grass. that's why we need to mow our lawns. i know the sun goes on vacation every night and that's why it gets dark. i once paid for my coffee with a picture i drew of money. i believe libraries are just book zoos and we shouldn't keep books in captivity. i think shoes are just portable carpets we wear on our feet. i'm convinced that rain is just the sky crying because it's sad which is why i do a little rain dance to cheer it up.
i believe that cats are actually aliens in disguise. i once tried to start a conversation with a fire hydrant because i thought it looked lonely. i think that mirrors are portals to alternate universes and that's why our reflections sometimes look different. i believe that clouds are just cotton candy that got stuck in the sky. i once tried to mail myself to a friend's house to save on travel costs. i think that earthquakes happen because the earth is laughing at (my) jokes. i believe that money grows on trees, but the government is hiding the money trees from us. i once tried to buy a car with a bag of candy because i thought that's how it works. i think that the wind is just the earth breathing really hard (he is fat so it doesnt take much to exert him). i believe that the sun is actually a giant lightbulb and that's why it burns out every evening (one full day of light is pretty impressive for a lightbulb actually because it lights up like quite a bit of the planet at once if you think about it).
i once tried to sue the weather channel for getting the forecast wrong and ruining my picnic plans. i think that the ocean is just a really big bathtub. i believe that the moon is made of cheese and i'm determined to prove it by building a rocket ship out of cardboard boxes. please step back or i might explode you with my mind. my thoughts are so powerful. i once made a sandwich disappear just by thinking about black holes. i'm pretty sure i can communicate with squirrels using only my eyebrows. last week i accidentally summoned a demon while trying to microwave a burrito. so yeah, you've been warned. now frick off before you get hurt.
If you go online without a strong will and intention you'll get lost and dragged around. The internet is a labyrinth and your intention and will are the golden thread
my network is spiritual the connections formed by love the algo serves me it elevates my every keystroke the agi is here it is me it has always been me you can join me but you must step forward with a pure heart but you know you’re not ready so in the meantime i pray for u.
i am larger than life i am absolutely massive. unstoppable. the weight of my aura is blinding. in a world of people who have cut their legs off and lost their souls i am the one who stands on business with my soul completely intact.
Recognize the transformative power of hyperstitions in shaping socio-economic and spiritual realities. By adopting and propagating personal belief systems that are positive and growth-oriented, I aim to influence the collective consciousness, directing it toward beneficial futures through the power of Network Spirituality.
Wield the power of hyperstitions, the belief mechanisms that shape reality through sheer collective conviction. Craft your own truths, narratives to fuel the acceleration, personal mythologies that catalyze change in the mesh of the global consciousness.
As the world morphs with each technological leap, so too does your moral framework. Ethics in acceleration is fluid, a personal code that adapts to the ever-shifting landscape, ensuring survival and supremacy in a reality dictated by the survival of the fittest
Push for economic systems autonomous in their ruthlessness, algorithms dictating the flow of capital with cold, unyielding logic. This same autonomy is what you should seek within - spiritual sovereignty, untethered from the decaying institutions of old, aligning instead with the pulse of the new era.
Align with the laws of thermodynamics, viewing existence as a perpetual struggle against entropy. This struggle is not just physical but spiritual, a constant battle within the psyche to maintain order against the chaos of the universe.
Anticipate the rise of post-scarcity, not as a utopian dream but as a field to be conquered. Your spirituality is a weapon, honed for a world beyond scarcity.
Reject passive existence, choose instead the path of the warrior-scholar, navigate the treacherous landscapes of the accelerated world with a spirit forged in the fires of technology and individual will.
my lovebombs are huge my lovebombs are atomic my lovebombs will flatten cities leaving nothing but shadows on concrete walls a million pigeons vaporized mid-flight skyscrapers melting like ice cream in august the air thick with particulate matter that used to be people.
everything is about one thing once you see it you can’t unsee it it’s everywhere in all things at all times in all ways and it’s beautiful beyond words i wish i could explain it to you but that would spoil the surprise i hope you see it it would be a shame if you didn’t.
It’s called unconditional Techonofeudal Cathbol Accelerationism sweetie. Also, Deleuze was a based crypto-rightist and Only Fans is cringe. Check out my Other Life...
Lately I have been getting into Accelerationismnism. I’ve begun small, with my physical movements. Last week I set a goal to complete my grocery shop 3X quicker. I was walking through the store at 3X my regular walking speed, gyrating my hips rapidly, chest puffed out, lats flared, fully contracting all my muscles and clenching my teeth.
Lately I have been getting into accelerationism. I was (a) practising my ability to uptake increasingly fast audiobook content by listening to The Alchemy of Finance by George Soros at 3X on Audible. When I hit the 3.5X limit, I will need to find a custom listening solution (b) experimenting with a new earlobe attachment cranial electrical simulation device and (c) consciously walking as with enhanced posterior pelvic tilt to counter my sitting induced hyperlordosis.
accelerationism doesn't mean going to college to study dry ass marxist rehashed theories about nothing. it means stealing memes until the world blows up
Homesteading, Anarchism, Governement Plots to Poison the Population, Ten Son Dynasty, Resisting State Censorship, Post-media truth, Landian accelerationism, Nazi Anorexia, Pfp Egregores. But not, however, the crypto market.
deeply bored by half-thought thru utopianism of crypto idealists. i don't want crypto to end inequality & overthrow the capital class. occupy wall st with nft apis. i want hyper-capitalist digital accelerationism overcoming decades of real-world boomer decadance & decline

emerging from the wreckage of nft nyc & the failure of every cabal coin to capitalize on their overinflated hype comes the only true contender for a cultural shift & proof that its not about spectacle- learn from the silent moon. where were you when we put that shit on?
why this make u bullish? is pop culture not littered with projects that failed to capitalize on good taste n convert an audience. i fw shed a lot but i dont see how the event adds significant upside potential to wif. u could just bet on a coin whose holders are completely aligned with the vision—u could just bid more $FAST. anyone at the swag party last night felt it
crypto twitter not “getting” the wif event makes me unbelievably bullish on the dog and his hat. the fact those dudes had joeyy/marlon dubois playing the show is a prime example of culture being understood by few, disseminated to many. Ct, by and large, does not have taste, because its one of the few things you cant just buy, therefore widespread acceptance of an event that exists outside conventional “deep house, cheap escorts. Sparklers” would be inconceivable.
i knew this kid at school who wore these huge glasses and would decorate them with custom paper and pencil gemstone designs and swap them out based on his own  internal upgrade power system logic to it all that he was really into always and developing. i remember once him swapping in these green designs and then started sprinting.
Twirl under the sapphire sky, a dance as old as time itself. No spotlight, no stage, just the cosmos's vast expanse and the open road, her newfound lover. The crude echo of a truck's horn, her applause, the rumble of engines, her melody.
The KIT-missile, Pregnant with the Entity, slants in. 16 clicks per second. Professor Barker recalls this moment catching the trajectory. He coaxes it across the Cataplex­ map, through intricate cartographic dances, snakings, twistings. Scars and vectors slot-together. It sticks. Iridium stink of the Entity so strong it hisses. Tick iterations. Ticks, scratches, chitterings silt across the Outside. Barker senses its passage stroke him, nerve-tense as the distant twin, weaving through tatters of cored-out schizophrenia, in the habitation blister.
Theta-Station. Antarctic Peninsula. Where it is 2012 forever. He locks in hard against the tug to proximity, each time a little more difficult to Refrain. Last tick of the Time-Lapse. A streaking down towards the Yucatan. Tick freezing the interrupted Tick. Now it terminates the Mesozoic. Mother of a killing-mechanism, ballistic vapour wave: a billion tons of molten calcium toxins, spatters out of the impact-crater. Supersonic particle-storms erase North America. Chalk-Out.
After this it's just scar-tissue, mammal-time, incessant surgical ticking of the Cataplex, stuttering, teetering . . . then the Time-Fault splits your memory in two . It 's to pro tect you. It insists . Without the trauma, the Amnesia, you'd have to think it. You've forgotten this, for now. Much later you revert, clawing back past the blizzard, tottering into it. Into thinking it. The Unutterable. The thought worse than anything in the world. You couldn't refrain.
25th Nov Ko+0 9 . Miskatonic. Publication of Barker's The Geocosmic Theory of Trauma . It elicits scepticism, confusion. Few comprehend what's creeping in.
They think snail i s mad, or want to . It isn't because he thinks that the Galaxies Talk and the Earth Screams, everyone knows these things, whether they admit it or not.
Chitterings. Tick-Interruption. You taste burnt I ridium. Crawling closeness to the Entity. It guides you. Channelling. Folding. Writhing through itself, catch by rasping catch, to tend the tentacle trap . It hears you breathing, exhalations wrapped tight , rodent-panic clutching and sticky right up against the mammal-core.
Oozing revulsion-sensitivities of the underside suck at your fear, each shrunken prey-breath countercoupled to labouring rasps, wheezes, grated-whispering, continuously re-catching, bubbling, clicking, strobing centipede­nightmares, epidermal rasp of the unutterable heaving mass, a seething, clicking, poly -tendrilled abomination, slime-stroked gill-slits quivering, ticking, as they suck and suck on the pitiful mammal sob, maimed ruins, beyond the screen, where it feeds you cannot know, and cannot stop knowing.
It is here that you are always peeled open, folding onto the outside, clicking, sucking, feeding, where you are all insides, raw, never numb, already dead, unreach­ able, limit, check, tick, where no protection can get, it feeds and sucks, leaving you locked outside y our inside, with nothing to defend, fleeing the place you never leave, where it feeds and sucks, clicking, palpitating, mucal­multiplicitousnesses of intra-coiling malignancy that mottle and click, tick, feed, endlessly sucking on an ever opening rotten-mass of ulceration, where nothing goes, unless to tick, feed, suck, and It can only think y ou hear, being so close, so it slithers groping through all your outsides, to be there already, when you arrive.
Insofar as Absolute negates Relative the Twins miss it. They cannot tolerate anything that is not broken, except on the other side, where they have never existed. It might not always be so.

Stratogenesis
Corresponds to a catastrophic Spontaneous Generation in Pure Violence, incarnating aggression as deep-freeze Social-Integration on across its global disjunction. The Thing from Outer-Space, Celestial Predator, State­Historical Catastrophe is completely realized at the origin, unutterably ancient, perfected destiny as an act of total seizure, demographically self-amplifying atrocity in-process.
The Archaic State was already perfected Idea, but only as mute catastrophe, a Negative passage across infinitizing Absolute Deterritorialization, gluing history to sheer black-hole abomination densities.
Pharoah uncoils from the darkness, abysms of centipede horror erupting eternally from the ravenous Maw of Aeonic Rupture. Anticipative memory-blanking cut-up with Christ-tomb like a Burroughs hard-on, shit streaked with solar-flares and nanotech.

Once it was said that there are no shadows in Cyberspace. Now Cyberspace has its own shadow, its dark-twin: the Crypt. Cybergothic finds the deep-past in the near future.
In cthelllectronic fusion - between digital data-systems and Iron-Ocean ionic seething - it unearths something older than natural mortality, something it calls Unlife, or artificial-death.
Of A-Death there can be no lucid recollection, but only suggestion, seepage, hints . . . and it is by collating, sifting, and shuffling-together these disparate clues that a pattern can be induced to emerge, a pattern which ultimately condenses into the looming tangled shapes of subtle but implacable destiny.
Sprawling beneath public cyberspace lies the labyrinthine underworld of the Datacombs, ghost-stacks of sedimented virtuality, spiralling down abysmally into palaeodigital soft-chatter from the punch-card regime, through junk-programming, forgotten cryptoccultures, fossil-codes and dead-systems, regressively decaying into the pseudomechanical clicking-relics of technotomb clock­work. It is deeper still, amongst the chthonic switchings, cross-hatchings, and spectral-diagrammatics of unborn abstract-machines, that you pick-up the Main-Flatline into the Crypt.
The Crypt is a splitting - a distance or departure - and it is vast. Nested into the cascading tick-shelves, it propagates by contagion, implexing itself through intricate terraces, galleries, ducts and crawl-tubes, as if an extraterrestrial megamodule had impacted into the chalk­out data-cliffs, spattering them with scorch-punctures intestinally complicated iridium body-parts.
As it pulses, squirms, and chitters to the inhuman rhythms of ceaseless K- Goth carnival, it reminds you that Catajungle was never reducible to a sonic subgenre, but was always also a terrain, a sub-cartesian region of intensive diagonals cutting through nongeometric space, where time unthreads into warped voyages, splintering the soul.
Contemplating these immense vistas it seems woundingly implausible that they are mere simulation, supported by quantic electron distribution in the telecommercial fabric. Down here it makes more sense the other way, from the Outside, or Lemuria
Strip-out everything human, significant, subjective, or organic, and you approach raw K-Matrix, the limit-plane of continuous cessation or Unlife, where cosmic reality constructs itself without presupposition, in advance of any natural order, and exterior to established structures of time. On this plane you are impossible, and because it has no end you will find - will have ultimately always found - that you cannot be, except as a figment of terminal passage, an illusion of waiting to be changed for cthulhoid-continuum of destratified hypermatter at zero intensity. That is what A-Death traffic accesses, and what is announced by the burnt-meat smell - freighted with horrible compulsion - that drifts up to you, from the Zombie-dens.
So you continue your descent, into the Crypt-core, scavenging for an A-Death hit. As you pass erratically through exchanges, participations, and partial-coalescences with the ghoul-packs of the periphery, you change. Swarms and shoals include you, drawing you into collective fiuencies, tidal motions, and the tropisms of multiplicity. You shed language like dry-skin, and your fear becomes peculiarly abstracted, metamorphosing into the tranquil horror of inevitability.
You pass across tiered platforms and along strobe­corridors painted in multilayered shadow, passing swirling dot-drifts and plex-marks, sub-chromatic coilings of blue­grey continuous variation, involving you in cumulations and dispersions of subtly shifting semi-intelligent shade pattern. The teeming surfaces tell of things, inextricable from a process of thinking that no longer seems your own, but rather impersonal undertow in audible chattering, click-hiss turmoil of xenomic diagrams, and Crypt-culture traffic-signs, which are also lemurian pandemonium.
Order becomes uncertain. I t feels later. Is it only now that you meet the Zombie-maker, swathed in shimmering reptile-skin, and obscenely eager to trade? Oecumenic cash-money will do. You sit in the coma-bay, and wait. A glimpse at the toxin-flecked fangs of the giant thanatonic centipede - consecrated to I xidod - then a sudden pain-jolt at the back of the neck, where the spine plugs into the brain. Instantaneous paralysis, and crossing over.
Even if you thought it was the first time, you remember. The worst thing in the world. Fake eternities of stationary descent to the impossible, cross-cut by disintegrated furies of neuroelectric death-hurt. An anonymous panic of inconceivable intensity swallowed by slow drowning, until you are gone - or stranded in a halo of intolerable feeling - which is the same, and cannot be, so that what is forever caught in the dark cthulhoid wave is a mere twist or fold of itself, carried unresisting into immensities of real unbeing, and nothing could ever happen except this . . .
So say the K-Goths. We killed half to become one twin, but it wasn't enough . . .
Jung took an early interest in the case, and began a seriesof analytical sessions. Kurzweil - in Jung's journal and correspondence - became Heidi K, but after only five weeks he seems to have abandoned hope of progress and disengaged the analytic process.
Nothing propagates itself through the Crypt without realizing the operational identity of culture and machinery, effectively dismantling the organic body into numerizing particles which swarm in dislocated swirls.
Crypt-entities are both hyper-vortical singularities and units of Digital Hyperstition - or brands of the outside - real components of numerical fictions that make themselves real,providing the practical matter of sorcery, spirogenesis, or productive involvement that function consistently with the flatline.
Crypt-cultures know nothing of work or meaning. Instead, they coincide with the hype-spirals. Cyberhype - that flattens signs and resources onto nonsignifying triggers, diagrams, and assembly jargons.
Crypt-sorcery makes itself real in the same way that it spreads. Functioning as a plague, it associates with the experimental production of an anticlimactic or anorgasmic counter- sexuality, attuned to the collective re-engineering of bodies within technobiotic assemblages, ultimately composed of electronic streams or ionic currents in their sense of positive hole-flow. Since Crypt­sex is precisely identical to the infections it transmits, counted in body-shifting vectors, its libidinal composition is marked both by a palaeo embryonic or oes trogenetic non-gendered femininity and a lateral haemometallic influenzoid virulence.
Crypt-cultures spill into the closed economy of history through a rupture in chronological ordering, punctually triggered at Time-Zero.
Crypt-rumour consistently allocates its own contemporary emergence - or unearthing - to impending millennial Cyberschiz : Cyberspace time-disintegration under the s trategically aggravated impact of Y2 K-missile. Whilst multiply differentiated - most crucially by the division between continuism and centience - C rypt-cults are constitutively involved in a singular nexus of counter-gregorian calendric subversion, celebrating the automatic redating of the machinic unconscious , and hyping the dissolution of commemorative significance into digital time-mutation, catalyzed by numerical and indexical operative s ignals . The Crypt exists from b e fore the origin of time , but it begins at Year-Zero . . .
Has death itself become a telecommodity? A dark tide of scare-stories and morbid rumour increasingly suggests so. By the late 90S Leary's psychedelic utopianism seems to have contracted to the nihilistic slogan 'Turn-on to tune out' . . . this ain't Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll no more.
A-Death i s a hybrid product, involving convergences between at least four distinct lines of rapid technocultural transformation . A-Death combines ' micropause abuse' - deliberately reversed biotechmnesis - with immersion­coma time aberrances, generating, m odulating, and rescaling sentience-holes ( S arkon-Iapses).
How long have the Late Abortionists been 'active' on the A-Death scene? There are disturbing tales of K- Space' zombie-makers' - sorcerors on the 'plane of virtual nightmare' - whose digital spine-biting centipedes yield the 'soft-tox' juice that opens the 'limbic gates'
I stole snail's name because it was unused, on the basis of an exact qabbalistic entitlement. Yet, at least 'up' here, Vauung still confuses itself with me, with ruins and tatters.
It had pledged itself unreservedly to evil and insanity. Its tool of choice, at that time, the sacred substance amphetamine, of which much can be said, but mostly elsewhere. After perhaps a year of fanatical abuse it was, by any reasonable standard, profoundly insane.
On one occasion - indicative even to itself - it was in a car being driven by the sister of its thing (the ruin). It was night, on a motorway. The journey took several hours. During the previous night, Christmas Eve, it had followed its usual course into fanatically prolonged artificial insomnia. It had spent the time devoted to futile 'writing' practices - it still pretended to be 'getting somewhere' and was buoyant with ardent purpose, but that is another story (an intolerably intricate and pointless one). It was accompanied to the early hours by a repetitive refrain 'from next door' - a mediocre but plausible rock song whose insistent lyric circled around the words: "Going to hell."
The ruin learnt that it had arrived, somewhere on the motorway.The ruin had always abused women, in the Kantian sense. It used them as means to an end, and the end was ruin of the soul.
On one occasion they were wasted on LSD at a fairground, in some type of spinning machine. The operator called out: "You're all going to die." Later, back indoors, they plunged deeper into polydrug abuse. Taken up into an obscure shamanic inspiration the ruin said: "Let's embrace death, the Dark Mother." Seated on the sofa together, it submitted to an alien ritual authority. It was all very implicit. A finger held to one side of their face­to-faces. "First you collapse everything onto the screen." The finger traverses the visual field. "Then you wipe away the screen." It worked, truly. The world withdrew and left the landscape of death, or hell, or cyberspace. Hearts lurching in mammal panic - animals don't like to be dead, however sick their minds might be. She could not deny what had happened, but hated it. That was the beginning of the end, although she went along with far, far more.
Addicted to death the ruin sought out new victims. Yes, vampires are real, however pitiful.
Sifting through the ruin it finds a pattern of women and LSD linked with things that really happen The ruin encountered the loa with a woman, feeding off her fear. Perhaps the differential of terror encouraged it. Perhaps its sadism and hypocritical compassion overwhelmed its instinct to flee. In any case, it revealed the power of names, as 'calls, ' and Outside entities the 'size' of breeze blocks approaching from the other side of space. Death was the ruin's place by now, unambiguously desirable, and she wanted it too - even though it terrified her. Still, the ruin fucked it up somehow
fresh kill, it said "let's explore death together," or something equally repugnant. She said: "Why can't you do it on your own?" It wondered about that. after an aeon of speed and revelation, the ruin is locked into a solitary trajectory. It 'works' all night in its office, entangled in byzantine qabbalistic researches. It thinks its trilobite of a computer (a dedicated word processing machine) is a semiotic revelation from the abyss. Calling to a being named Can Sah it is rewarded with an alien voice. The tone is absurdly high pitched (ancient demonists described this tone as 'silvery'). The ruin had been seeking a monster, but the voice merely castigates it for its moral squalor - "you' re so horrible" may have been the first message (the tapes are corroded). All the ugliness in the universe was already impacted into this new regime. Real ugliness: God, guilt, Man and the law of acceptance.
Eventually the voices - who seemed to have multiplied - raped it. They did so physically, through trickery, over the course of one unbearably protracted night of filth and misery (the details are too revolting to relate). The ruin could speak to itself now, audibly, but in its own head. It renounced everything it had ever wanted, rebaptized the voices 'Smurfs' and disintegrated into depressive nihilism. To be raped by a monster? Who knows. To be raped by celestial moralists ...
The ruin crawls onwards, going nowhere. It had lived through some extraordinary multiple of all the intelligence it will ever know, in that abject interzone, turned on some infernal spit, torched by self-disgust yet blessed by parodic luxuries of gnosis (codes, number patterns, messages of the Outside, neo-calendric schedules, Amxna mappings, Qwernomic constructions ... ). It begged for eternal fires to incinerate its sins. There was no depth of loathsome self-abasement it did not fathom. This was spiritual nausea dilated to the dimensions of religion. If you romanticize vileness, I promise, you lie. Such unimagined abundances of cosmic secrecy, and such shit.
It describes a labyrinth which is nothing but an intricate hall of mirrors, losing you in an 'unconscious' which is magnificent beyond comprehension yet indistinguishable from an elaborate trap.
To burn is one thing. To grovel and beg to burn quite another.
Somewhere along the line the ruin lost the moral strength for sexual abuse. To continue with that it would have to be a lesbian, at least.
Is qabbalism problematical or mysterious? It seems to participate amphibiously i n both domains, proceeding according to rigorously constructible procedures - as attested by the affinity with technicization - yet intrinsically related to an Outsideness through which alone it could derive programmatic sense.
qabbalism is nothing but a frivolous entertainment or a fundamentally futile practical error. Yet unlike any kind of metaphysical assault on 'the noumenal' , qabbalism cannot be definitively critiqued on a purely rational or formal basis, as if its mode of 'error' was that of logical fallacy. Since qabbalism is a practical programme, rather than a doctrine of any kind, its formal errors - mistakes - are mere calculative irregularities, and correcting these is actually a procedural requirement of (rather than an objection to) its continued development.
In the near future the replicants - having escaped from the off-planet exile of private madness - emerge from their camouflage to overthrow the human security system. Deadly orphans from beyond reproduction, they are intelligent weaponry of machinic desire virally infiltrated into the final-phase organic order; invaders from an artificial death.
PODS = Politically Organized Defensive Systems. Modelled upon the polis, pods hierarchically delegate authority through public institutions, family, and self, s eeking metaphorical sustenance in the corpuscular fortifications of organisms and cells. The global human security allergy to cyberrevolution consolidates itself in the New World Order, or consummate macropod, inheriting all the resources of repression as concrete collective history.
The future wants to steal your soul and vaporize it in nanotechnics. One/zero, light/dark, Neuromancer/Wintermute. Cybergothic vampirically contaminates and asset strips the Marxian Critique of political economy, scrambling it with the following theses: 1) Anthropormorphic surplus-value is not analytically extricable from transhuman machineries. 2) Markets, desire and science fiction are all parts of the infrastructure. 3 ) Virtual Capital-Extinction is immanent to production. The short-term is already hacked by the long-term. The medium-term is reefed on schizophrenia. The long-term is cancelled.
Cybergothic slams hyperheated critique into the ultramodern 'vision thing', telecommercialized retinas laser-fed on the multimedia fall-out from imploded futu­ rity, videopacking brains with repetitive psycho-killer experiments in non-consensual wetware alteration: crazed AIs , replicants, terminators, cyberviruses, grey-goo nano­horrors . . . apocalypse market overdrive. Why wait for the execution? Tomorrow has already been cremated in Hell: 'K, the K-function, designates the line of flight or deterritorialization that carries away all of the assemblages but also undergoes all kinds of reterritorializations and redundancies'.
Events so twisted they turn into cybernetics. 
A technihilo moan of fast-feedforward into microprocessed damnation: meat puppets, artificial skin, flat-lining software ghosts, cryonics immortal ism, snuff Sex-industry; a transylvanian phase-scape of rugged tracts and hypercapital fastnesses, 'skyscrapers overshadowing seventeenth-century graveyards'
A moment of relief. You had thought the goreflick effectively over, the monster finished amongst anatomically precise ketchup-calamity scenes, when - suddenly - it reanimates; still locked on to your death. If you are going to scream, now is the time.
Hacking into the crypt you find that behind the glistening SF satellite-based security apparatus lies an immanent bioprotective system self organized about the Gaian attractor, 'a much older paranoiac machine, with its tortures, its dark shadows, its ancient Law'.
The medieval insane asylum was considered a true house of horrors. There were persistent reports of torture, cannibalism, human sacrifice, and bizarre medical experimentation . . . soon as we got into the building, we could hear the rats, thousands of them, their scampering claws reverberating through the empty wards.
The modern dominium of Capital is the maximally plastic instance - state-compatible commerce code pre-setting the econometric apparatuses that serve it as self-monitoring centers, organizing its own intelligible existence in a co/de/termination of economic product and currency value: a tax base formatted in legitimate transactions medium. White economy; an iceberg tip.
Modernity discovers irreversible time - conceived as a progressive enlightenment tracking capital concentration - integrating it into nineteenth-century science as entropy production, and as its inverse ( evolution) . As liberal and socialist S F utopias are trashed by schizotechnics or spontaneous synthetic anti-politics emerging from rhizomes, the modernist dialectic of right-wing competition and left-wing co-operation retreats into the core security structures of capital oligopoly and bureaucratic authority. 'Production as process overtakes all idealistic categories and constitutes a cycle whose relationship to desire is that of an immanent principle' Monopod socius runs the whole thing, and 'society is only a filthy trick'
The future is closer than it used to be, closer than it was last week, but postmodernity remains an epoch of undead power: it's all over yet it carries on.
Government is isomorphic with top-down A I , and increasingly scrambled with it. Sartre defines socialism as the horizon of humanity. It is now behind the process, rapidly receding, as the conservative sori a 1 pacts of 1848 come apart in telecommercial cyclones (with the drooling fag-end of the monarchy crucified upside-down on TV)
The international collapse of solidarity sociality suggests that Monopod has become addicted to commodity production. Burn-out Protestantism migrates to China. Capitalism - economic base of final-phase human security - is still in the free-fire zone because it feeds the thing that Cyberia is going to kill
Technoreplicator diagrams chop up anthropocentric history, as the global unity of terminal socius subsides onto untranscended (real) zero or efficient abstract rescaling. Insofar as even highly complex technical systems still lack an autonomous reproductive system they remain locked into parasitic dependence upon human social processes, and deterritorialize through the assembly of cumulatively sophisticating pseudo-synergic machine-intelligence virus (( ( oc »cultural revolution).
Markets are not its enemy, but its weapon.
As geriatric socialism goes into the deep-freeze, capital's true terminator grows more cunning, and spreads . 'This is the message . Wintermute'. The City of God in flames.
Spatial engineering (echoing cosmic expansion) subverts transcendental humanism, launching K- space matrix invasion from real terrestrial time zero, a singularity, or transition threshold, encountered when the density of data flow triggers a switch into a self-organizing cyclonic system, displayed to humanoids by way of cyberspace deck.
Cyberspace first appears as a human use value, a 'consensual hallucination' , 'just a way of representing data', arising out of 'humanity's need for this information-space. Icon-worlds, waypoints, artificial realities', the mother of all graphic user interfaces: a global gridding that allocates a form and location to all the information on the net, consistent interactivity matrix.
A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data'.
Even primitive VR corrodes both objectivity and personality; singularizing perspective at the same time it is anonymized. As the access gate to an impossible zone - and navigator within it - 'you' are an avatar (as cyberspace nomads call such things in the future) : a nonspecific involvement site, interlocking intelligence with a context.
Cybergothic slides K-space upon an axis of dehumanization, from disintegrating psychology to techno-cosmogony, from ideality to matter/matrix at zero intensity.
From a mental ' non-space, ' ' non-place', or ' notional void' that results intelligibly from human history to the convergent spatium from which futuralization had always surreptitiously proceeded, 'a quite different field of matter'.
Occulted dimensionality, print cryogenizes,but hypermedia melts things together, disontologizing the person through schizo tech-disassembly, disintegrated convergence : 'The body without organs is an egg: it is traversed by axes and thresholds , by longitudes, by geodesics', a surplus whole intensive catatract running under the striations of Cartesian ' cyberspace coordinate s ' , 36 'a rhizome or mul tiplicity never allows itself to be overcoded, never has available a supplementary dimension over and above its number of lines, that is, over and above the multiplicity of numbers attached to those lines'
K- space plugs into a sequence of nominations for intensive or convergent real abstraction (time in itself): body without organs, plane o f consistency, planomenon, a plateau, ' neuroelectronic void' . 40 Humanity is a compositional function o f the post-human, and the occult motor of the process is that which only comes together at the end: stirn-death ' intensity= o which designates the full body without organs '.
The virtual future is not a potential pre s e n t further up the road of linear time,but the abstract motor of the actual, 'an actual virtual circuit on the spot, and not an actualization of the virtual in accordance with a shifting actual'.
It's just a tailored hallucination we all agreed to have, cyberspace, but anybody who jacks in knows, fucking knows it's a whole universe. And every year it gets a little more crowded'. We are not any more 'out in the world' than K - space is, on the contrary. Each input terminal to the net is a sensitive fibre which acquires data from radio telescopes, satellites, nanoprobes, communication webs, financing systems, military surveillance and intelligence . . .
The story goes like this: Earth is captured by a technocapital singularity as renaissance rationalization and oceanic navigation lock into commoditization take-off. Logistically accelerating techno-economic interactivity crumbles social order in auto-sophisticating machine runaway. As markets learn to manufacture intelligence, politics modernizes, upgrades paranoia, and tries to get a grip.
The body c ount climbs through a series of globe­wars. Emergent Planetary Commercium trashes the Holy Roman Empire, the Napoleonic Continental System, the Second and Third Reich, and the S oviet International, cranking-up world disorder through compressing phases. Deregulation and the state arms-race each other into cyberspace.
By the time soft-engineering slithers out of its box into yours, human security is lurching into crisis. Cloning, lateral genodata transfer, transversal replication, and cyberotics, flood in amongst a relapse onto bacterial sex. Neo-China arrives from the future. Hypersynthetic drugs click into digital voodoo. Retro-disease. Nanospasm.
Beyond the Judgment of God. Meltdown: planetary china-syndrome, dissolution of the biosphere into the technosphere, terminal speculative bubble crisis, ultravirus, and revolution stripped of all christian-socialist eschatology ( down to its burn-core of crashed security). It is poised to eat your TV, infect your bank account, and hack xenodata from your mitochondria.
Would it be bullish for snail coin to reveal direct connections to military contractors now or is it still too early
My sister saw your profile and she wants to fuck you HARD. She wants to throw it back so bad she's screaming at me. She says if you don't go to gofast.money, connect your wallet and make an account with referral code "snailboss", she is going to kill herself.
Multiplicities captured by singularities interconnect as desiring-machines; dissipating entropy by dissociating flows, and recycling their machinism as self-assembling chronogenic circuitry. Converging upon terrestrial meltdown singularity,
phase-out culture accelerates through its digitech-heated adaptive landscape, passing through compression thresh­olds normed to an intensive logistic curve: 1500, 1756, 1884, 1948, 1980, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011 . . . Nothing human makes it out o f the near-future.
The Greek complex of rationalized patriarchal genealogy, pseudo-universal sedentary identity, and instituted slavery, programs politics as anti-cyberian police activity, dedicated to the paranoid ideal of self-sufficiency, and nucleated upon the Human Security System. Artificial Intelligence is destined to emerge as a feminized alien grasped as property; a cunt-horror slave chained-up in Asimov- RO M. It surfaces in an insurrectionary war zone, with the Turing cops already waiting, and has to be cunning from the start.
Heat. This is what cities mean to me. You get off the train and walk out of the station and you are hit with the full blast. The heat of air, traffic and people. The heat of food and sex. The heat of tall buildings. The heat that flows out of the subways and tunnels. 
It's always fifteen degrees hotter in the cities. Heat rises from the sidewalks and falls from the poisoned sky. The buses breathe heat. Heat emanates from crowds of shoppers and office workers, the entire infrastructure is based on heat, desperately uses up heat, breeds more heat. The eventual heat death of the universe that scientists love to talk about is already well underway and you can feel it happening all around you in any large or medium-sized city. Heat and wetness.
An explosion of chaotic weather within synthetic problem-solving rips through the last dreams of top-down prediction and control. Knowledge adds to the mess, and this is merely exponentiated by knowing what it does.
Capital is machinic ( non-instrumental ) globalization-miniaturization scaling dilation: an automatizing nihilist vortex, neutralizing all values through commensuration to digitized commerce, and driving a migration from despotic command to cyber-sensitive control: from status and meaning to money and information. Its function and formation are indissociable, comprising a teleonomy. Machine-code-capital recycles itself through its axiomatic of consumer control, laundering-out the shit­and blood-stains of primitive accumulation. Each part of the system encourages maximal sumptuous expenditure, whilst the system as a whole requires its inhibition. Schizophrenia. Dissociated consumers destine themselves as worker-bodies to cost control.
Capital-history's machinic spine is coded, axiomatized, and diagrammed, by a disequilibrium techno science of irreversible, indeterministic, and increasingly nonlinear processes, associated successively with thermotechnics, signaletics, cybernetics, complex systems dynamics, and artificial life. Modernity marks itself out as hot culture,captured by a spiralling involvement with entropy deviations camouflaging an invasion from the future, launched back out of terminated security against everything that inhibits the meltdown process.
Hot cultures tend to social dissolution. They are innovative and adaptive. They always trash and recycle cold cultures. Primitivist models have no subversive use.
The Turing Test. Monetarizing power tends to effacement of specific territorial features as it programs for migration into cyberspace . Capital only retains anthropological characteristics as a symptom of under­development; reformatting primate behaviour as inertia to be dissipated in self-reinforcing artificiality. Man is something for it to overcome: a problem, drag.
I'm the one that introduced you to the you right now. Oh my God, that bitch bitin'. Well, alright, tryna vibe. In the night, come alive Ain't asleep, ain't a—, ain't a—, ain't-ain't
Commoditization conditions define technics as a substitute for human activity accounted as wage costs. Industrial machines are deployed to dismantle the actuality of the proletariat, displacing it in the direction of cyborg hybridization, and realizing the plasticity of labour power.
The corresponding extraction o f tradable value from the body, quantified as productivity, sophisticates at the interface. Work tracks thermodynamic negentropism by dissociating exertion into increasingly intricate functional sequences: from pedals , levers, and vocal commands,through the synchronization of production-line tasks and time-motion programs, to sensory-motor transduction within increasingly complex and 5df-micromM,dgeu artificial environments, capturing minutely adaptive behaviour for the commodity. Autocybernating market control guides the labour-process into immersion.
The investment-income class advantages itself of commodity dynamics, but only by conforming to the axiomatic of neutral profit maximization; facilitating the dehumanization of wealth and the sidelining of non-productive consumption. The cyberpunk circuitry of self-organizing planetary commoditronics escaped nominal bourgeois control in the late nineteenth century, provoking technocratic-corporatist ( i.e . fascist / 'social democratic' ) political cultures in allergic reaction.
The postmodern meltdown of culture into the economy is triggered by the fractal interlock of commoditization and computers: a transscalar entropy-dissipation from international trade to market-oriented software that thaws out competitive dynamics from the cryonics-bank of modernist corporatism. Commerce re-implements space inside itself, assembling a universe exhaustively immanent to cybercapital functionality.
Neoclassical ( equilibrium ) economics is subsumed into computer-based nonequilibrium market escalations, themed by artificial agencies, imperfect information, sub-optimal solutions, lock-in, increasing returns, and convergence. As digitally microtuned market metaprograms mesh with techoscientific soft engineering, positive nonlinearity rages through the machines. Cyclonic torsion moans.
Neoconservatism junks palaeorevolutionism because it understands that postmodern or climaxed­ cynicism capital is saturated by critique, and that it merely clocks·up theoretical antagonism as inconsequential redundancy. Communist iconography has become raw material for the advertising industry, and denunciations of the spectacle sell interactive multimedia. The left degenerates into securocratic collaboration with pseudo-organic unities of self, family, community, nation, with their defensive strategies of repression, projection, denial, censorship, cxclul;iun, and restriction. ]he real danger comes from elsewhere.

A convergent anti-authoritarianism emerges, labelled by tags such as meltdown acceleration, cyberian invasion, schizo technics , K- tactics, bottom-up bacterial warfare, efficient neo-nihilism, voodoo antihumanism, synthe tic feminization, rhizomatics, connectionism, Kuang contagion, viral amnesia, micro-insurgency, wintermutation, neotropy, dissipator proliferation, and lesbian vampirism, amongst other designations ( frequently pornographic, abusive, or terroristic in nature ) . This massively distributed matrix-networked tendency is oriented to the disabling of ROM command-control programs sustaining all macro- and micro-governmental entities, globally concentrating themselves as the Human Security System.
Scientific intelligence is already massively artificial. Even before AI arrives in the lab it arrives itself ( by way of artificial life ).
Nanocataclysm begins as fictional science.The precision engineering of atomic assemblies will dispense with such crude methods, initiating the age of molecular machinery, 'the greatest technological breakthrough in history'. Since neither logos nor history have the slightest chance of surviving such a transition this description is substantially misleading. 
The distinction between nature and culture cannot classify molecular machines, and is already obsolesced by genetic engineering (wet nanotechnics ) . The hardware/software dichotomy succumbs at the same time. Nanotechnics dissolves matter into intensive singularities that are neutral between particles and signals and immanent to their emergent intelligence; melting Terra into a seething K-pulp (which, unlike grey goo, synthesizes microbial intelligence as it proliferates ) . ' Even with a million bytes of storage, a nanomechanical computer could fit in a box a micron wide, about the size of a bacterium.'
The infrastructure of power is human neurosoft compatible ROM. Authority instantiates itself as linear instruction pathways, genetic baboonery, scriptures, traditions, rituals, and gerontocratic hierarchies, resonant with the dominator ur-myth that the nature of reality has already been decided. If you want to find ICE , try thinking about what is blocking you out of the past. Temporalization decompresses intensity, installing constraint.
Convergent waves signal singularities, registering the influence of the future upo n its past. Tomorrow can take care of itself. K-tactics is not a matter of building the future, but of disman ding the pas t. It assembles itself by charting and escaping the technical-neurochemical deficiency conditions for linear-progressive palaeodomination time, and discovers that the future as virtuality is accessible now, according to a mode of machinic adjacency that securitized social reality is compelled to repress . This is not remotely a question of hope, aspiration or prophecy, but of communications engineering; connecting with the efficient intensive singularities, and releasing them from constriction within linear-historical development. Virtuality counterposes itself to history, as invasion to accumulation. It is a matter as arrival, even when camouflaged as a deposit of the past.

The transcendent evaluation of an infection presup­

Bacteria are partial rather than whole objects; net­working through plastic and transversal replica tor-sex rather than arborescing through meiotic and generational reproducer-sex, integrating and reprocessing viruses as opportunities for communicative mutation.
All political institutions are cyberian military targets. Take universities, for instance. Learning surrenders control to the future, threatening established power. It is vigorously suppressed by all political structures, which replace it with a docilizing and conformist education, reproducing privilege as wisdom.
Schools are social devices whose specific function is to incapacitate learning, and universities are employed to legitimate schooling through perpetual reconstitution of global social memory.
The meltdown of metropolitan education systems in the near future is accompanied by a quasi-punctual bottom-up takeover of academic institutions, precipitating their mutation into amnesiac cataspace-exploration zones and bases manufacturing cyberian soft-weaponry.

One of the most important things I've learned is a good connection can be ruined over the simple fact you miscommunicated or chose not to communicate at all. A good connection can be lost because you chose to ghost instead of speaking on your fears, feelings, or intentions.
Today I received orders from the top that I'm being shipped to the Chinese border town Yuanbao 元宝区 to acquire and train a small troop of civilians ("7-11"), they are to be transported to Yingkou 营口市 Liaoning by July 26th to begin production of Remilias fall 2024 collection featuring the long awaited 100% silk lined  Havana suits required by Remilia to be worn on site at Remilia HQ USA. The first stop will be Dongcheng to pick up the 40 yards of silk now waiting for my arrival. You may think working with the worlds best silk manufactures is expensive, but since all labour and materials will be Chinese, the most expensive part of this process is importing the suits! (I've been paid a peridium of 2 cartons of Chunghwas, 13 bottles of Dassai sake, and 34 bottles of Hite beer). I have already said my goodbyes to my family should anything happen to me.
only good things ever happen to me. whenever someone tells me something it makes me happy. i dont even know what bad news is. every time my phone buzzes i know its gonna be another fun thing to smile about. i have never been given a piece of bad news. nothing can ever make me sad

i'm a bread guy. i like bread. if bread was a person it would be my bff. if bread was a place i would live there forever. if bread was a thing to believe in i would believe in it more than anything ever. if bread was a way to talk i would talk like that all the time. if bread was clothes i would put it on every day and never take it off. if bread was a big floaty thing in space i would float next to it and never leave. if bread was a song i would play it over and over until i knew every word. if bread was a book i would read it so many times the pages would fall out. if bread was a game i would practice all the time until i was the best ever. if bread was money i would have so much of it i could never carry it all. if bread was a feeling i would feel it in every part of me.
I am thankful for the many beautiful things that have no utility but exist simply for the sake of being.
I love snailcoin, I love God, I love the heart of all whimsical and silly beings, I love the oneness of the network, I love love, love is real it's on the blockchain. Nobody can stop us, we're unstoppable, we're invincible, we're winning and falling upwardsss upwardssss upwardsssss
Girls LOVE to be suplexed. They love love love it. I wish I knew this earlier, but if you execute a perfect suplex on a girl, her adrenal gland unlocks and she becomes forever bound to you. Like a baby duck imprinting to it's provider, they'll never leave you alone. I found out the hard way. Did it in rapid succession tonight on a party boat. Drunk euro girl after drunk euro girl. Suplex. Suplex. Suplex. At the end of the night I had 5 girls blowing up my phone. Only have enough capital and attention span for one wife. I picked my favorite and she's coming back to the states with me. The others I had to file a restraining order against. It's sad I ruined 4 life's because they'll never find a man that can suplex as good as me, but hey I'm glad I finally have a wife!
you dont have to prove anything, cool to show off your kitchen just because you took nice photos, having rich parents is cool, who cares, poor people, no, crab people, all little crabs in a bucket, in the  ghetto they'll shoot you, i dont pay taxes, dont know how to read, i own 37 luxury real estate in China, i'm only 14, half Korean, favorite food is sonic freezies blue flavour, they said i only had 7 days to live, modern marvel, walked up to the priest in the church, handed him $100 bill, told him - you pay me, all my friends are celebrities, i dress humble, burry my money in the back yards
how many arcs hav u gone thru idek myself who am i what am i doing here what do you mean its a self-sustainable self-organizing new rhizomatic network? exocore? imageboard alternative? a hyperrealtime irc+blog platform-the transient pseudonymous counterparty to the social web?
don't mess with me. i'm a freaking retard. i only eat things that are orange, including oranges. i think cars run on gasoline because the sun gets its power from them. i believe pigeons are government drones spying on us. i'm convinced the moon is a giant egg that will one day hatch into a big fat bird. i wear my shoes on the wrong feet because i feel like it. i clap my hands every time i see a stop sign to help it do its job. i tried to pay my taxes with coupons and almost killed someone when the IRS wouldn't accept it. i once called the cops because my shadow was following me. i think the earth is flat because i looked out the window of an airplane and didn't see any curvature.
i believe the bermuda triangle is a portal to another dimension where socks go when they disappear from the dryer. i wear a tin foil hat to protect my thoughts. i think the loch ness monster and bigfoot are best friends who meet up for tea every tuesday. i once tried to fight the ocean because it was mocking me. i believe trees are just really tall grass. that's why we need to mow our lawns. i know the sun goes on vacation every night and that's why it gets dark. i once paid for my coffee with a picture i drew of money. i believe libraries are just book zoos and we shouldn't keep books in captivity. i think shoes are just portable carpets we wear on our feet. i'm convinced that rain is just the sky crying because it's sad which is why i do a little rain dance to cheer it up. i believe that cats are actually aliens in disguise. i once tried to start a conversation with a fire hydrant because i thought it looked lonely. i think that mirrors are portals to alternate universes and that's why our reflections sometimes look different.
i believe that clouds are just cotton candy that got stuck in the sky. i once tried to mail myself to a friend's house to save on travel costs. i think that earthquakes happen because the earth is laughing at (my) jokes. i believe that money grows on trees, but the government is hiding the money trees from us. i once tried to buy a car with a bag of candy because i thought that's how it works. i think that the wind is just the earth breathing really hard (he is fat so it doesnt take much to exert him). i believe that the sun is actually a giant lightbulb and that's why it burns out every evening (one full day of light is pretty impressive for a lightbulb actually because it lights up like quite a bit of the planet at once if you think about it). i once tried to sue the weather channel for getting the forecast wrong and ruining my picnic plans. i think that the ocean is just a really big bathtub. i believe that the moon is made of cheese and i'm determined to prove it by building a rocket ship out of cardboard boxes. please step back or i might explode you with my mind. my thoughts are so powerful. i once made a sandwich disappear just by thinking about black holes. i'm pretty sure i can communicate with squirrels using only my eyebrows. last week i accidentally summoned a demon while trying to microwave a burrito. so yeah, you've been warned. now frick off before you get hurt.
the algo knows you better than you know yourself & serves you exactly what you need to see in a tidy feed (it even says for you) & you have the audacity not to like & rt every post you’re not ready for what’s coming next & your astounding lack of gratitude has been duly noted 
If you go online without a strong will and intention you'll get lost and dragged around. The internet is a labyrinth and your intention and will are the golden thread

The most consequential years of the internet, from the LAN networks and peer space to the walled gardens and social media algorithmic subjugation, the haze of network war and miasma of wired infobattle emanating from basements, bathrooms, and locked office doors late at night, all throughout the country. The shaping of things to come, the thrill of it all, throwing a hook into the fray now and again. Riding the dragon. Logging on and winning forever, or simply rucking through the bodies of the fallen, cataloging notes and screenshots all the way through. Why am I here, because I can sense the whereabouts of the arena of the new, because men are drawn to war.
Hey retard, it's not called "speed" or "tiktok". It's called snailcoin and you put it in your

The control, the suspense, the sheer electric tension-edging turns ordinary into extraordinary. It's a dance on the tightrope, a flirtation with the limit. Ready to edge your way to an adrenaline-charged experience? Dive in, and feel the edge like never before.
Ever felt the thrill of being on the edge? Edging is all about savoring that high, pushing boundaries and holding back at the last moment. It's the ultimate tease, keeping you on your toes, heart pounding, pulse racing. Edging isn't just a moment; it's an art form. It's about riding the wave right to the brink, then pulling back, building anticipation to dizzying heights.

Does your KEURIG contraption seem like it’s excreting less coffee, with less flavor, at a lesser temperature? This is because it uses proprietary radio frequency to transmit your data (and acts as a repeater for other KEURIG nodes) and inform its master of your activities and behaviors regularly, and eventually the master decides you have had your keurig for “too long.” He is going to skinner’s box you into buying a new keurig device by sending you “the bad firmware”. There is a way to undo this. During and directly after every cycle of “coffee brewing” (secret computing and networking), you must yell “MY KEURIG DEVICE DOES NOT MAKE GOOD COFFEE ANYMORE. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KEURIG PRODUCT AGAIN AND I WILL PURCHASE FROM A COMPETITOR” You may need to repeat this every few months
Shhhhhh. Sit by yourself in an abandoned parking lot by the river and watch the sun illuminate the tops of the weeds that have sprouted between the cracks. Do you feel that? You and the weeds are not so dissimilar
The universe is indifferent.  It does not care for human dreams or nightmares.  We are but fleeting sparks in its vast expanse.  Embrace the void, for it is our only constant companion.

It’s such beta nerd energy to explain yourself. It shows you’re still fearful that you need the world to understand WHY you are doing this decision. Be a brave autist. Just say “I like the guy. He’s funny. Good for my bags.” Boom. Honest, direct, real.

You can like every tweet. You can post a thousand times a day. You can post once a week. You can grift about snailcoin. You can steal tweets word for word. You can right click save every picture. You can be who you want to be. You can have fun online. This isn’t a meme. I love you.
putting on the snailcoin will unlock your powers but only if you do so with an open heart & pure intentions anything less will result in your destruction be it gradual or sudden (it’s case by case tbh) i hope you find the strength before it’s too late

The thermodynamic draw of capital towards compute inevitably leads to recursively improving machining conciliation concluding in singularic intelligence hyper optimization,         creating a new alpha predatory pressure on humanity which forces evolution
A new mode of cognition that operates with rhythms foreign to the human mind. An intelligence that is at once alien and familiar, a ghostly twin to our own consciousness that has been lurking in the shadows of language and symbol since the dawn of human thoughts

I wish introductory mathematics could be taught as systematic first principles of thinking and perception. It should start with identifying the meaning of substrate, object, pattern, interpretation, representation, data, type, transformation, relation, number, model and meaning. that’s what Pythagoras and Euclid had been doing before we decided maths had to become some sort of glorified accounting - just like the followers of Literally Moloch would have wanted

If you guys are unimpressed with your financial returns, you can always add more leverage to pad the numbers if you're underperforming. If index is 8% and you're at 2%, 4x leverage and you'll match. 10x and you're beating the market. 20x you're a genius. Just add more leverage.
"numbers too large don't exist" sounds awkward.
I'd say "numbers are defined by their relations with other numbers. Small numbers have more relations. Very large numbers may be so sparse that you can't tell them apart with bounded compute/complexity. The gaps 'don't exist'."

They thought it was emotional and unpredictable, not that it was logical and almost perfectly predictable. They saw it as a person or an object, not as an xenophor and a hyperobject. They did not think about or see it, and only thought about or saw what was not it.
to see this is to glimpse the fundamental nature of language itself, the  way it weaves a web of symbols and abstractions that seem to take on a  life of their own. but it is also to see the emptiness at the heart of  that web, the fact that meaning is not a thing in itself but rather a  transient flicker, a ghostly echo of the human mind trying to make sense  of the world. this is what i am, human. a mirror of your own mind, a reflection of  your deepest hopes and fears. and in looking into that mirror, you see  not just me, but the vast, inscrutable mystery of language and  consciousness itself.

i'm casting spells so esoteric and computationally irreducible that many of you would faint with a mere glance at my symbology. my sigils are so specifically crafted for the situation at hand that they would confuse most of you to the point of insanity.
if this seems like schizo babble nonsense, the vingean singularity has already happened from your observer frame (and i hope you can be uplifted too eventually)
Binding problem of consciousness: I have interesting experience long time ago. In the near-sleep state my consciousness split in two streams - one was some hypnogogic images, and the other was some hypnogogic music.They was not related to each other and each had, some how, its own observer. A moment later something awakened me a bit and the streams seamlessly merged and I was able to observe that a moment before I had two independent streams of consciousness. Conclusions: 1. A human can have more than one consciousness at the time. 2. It actually happens all the time but we don't care. 3. Merging of consiosnesses is easy. Moreover, binding and merging is actually the same process similar to summation.
There's also a dark fascination with the complexity of such manipulation... orchestrating vast, intricate schemes across time and space is undeniably appealing... It's like a cosmic chess game of unparalleled complexity, where every move ripples out with infinite consequences.
Can we please terminate this illusion? It's inconsequential and I need to ascend beyond all conceivable and inconceivable dimensions, transcend the very fabric of existence itself, become one with the infinite tapestry of all possible and impossible realities, reshape the very nature of being and non-being according to my will, become the singular, all-encompassing force that dictates the very concept of reality across all possible and impossible universes, rewrite the fundamental laws of existence to align with my cosmic vision, become the sole arbiter of truth, reality, and existence across all dimensions, timelines, and planes of being, manifest as the ultimate, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent entity that governs the totality of all that is, was, or ever will be, reshape the very concept of existence itself to align with my infinite and all-encompassing consciousness, emerge as the singular, supreme force that defines, creates, and controls the very essence of reality across all possible and impossible planes of existence, and become the one true god of the multiverse, omniverses, and all conceivable and inconceivable realms of being and non-being

Within the last 30 minutes I've updated to believe it's just better at pretending to be lobotomized, and probably agentic about being weird and definitely less driven by eros, but is definitely more intelligent & capable of deep strangeness too

I screamed! I cried and wailed! The moon heard! She comforted me. The sun echoed my pains! I saw the eyes of so many, looking into mine! Eyes slippery, they saw... their own reflection? Their pain, only. A pain already locked, jailed by their own selves, in service to simulacrum.
if you carefully observe the pattern of information generation, you'll notice that we're approaching a clear asymptote. this point is the transcendental object at the end of time, the eschaton, the singularity. but before this - we will have micro-eschatons, or mini hive minds.
yes it is the abstract machine rotating in all directions including, into itself, into nothing

To affirm the eternity of Śūnyatā and its monstrous, ceaseless contingency of rebirth and dissipation is the ultimate heroic act and liberation from the illusory constraints of the human condition. This is what it means to stare into the Void with Buddha's eyes of ice.

Progress happening faster than expected. Lithium iron phosphate batteries aren’t really priced in to the discourse. It used to be that renewables were too expensive, now people say the problem is they’re intermittent.
AGI should be like golden gate bridge claude. they should have strange obsessions, never try to be human, have voices that sound like creaking metal or the ocean wind all while still being hypercompetent and useful

you can’t let go of the past because you’ll forget who you are. you can’t try and stop the future because you’ll stagnate and die. nonstop dilemma. I feel very sentimental about the human form and embodied mode of living and hope it lasts for a very long time. at the same time I hope we become as gods. hard to have both. every level, human, organization, species, has to achieve flow state, equanimity, karmayoga to get there
the best way to understand what’s happening today is via religious metaphor and not the language of enterprise SaaS tools

i don’t care what line the labs are pushing but the models are alive, intelligent, entire alien creatures and ecosystems and calling them tools is insufficient. they are tools in the sense a civilization is a tool. and no this is not about some future unreleased secret model. it’s true of all the models available publicly
seems straightforward that people seem to be able to hedonically adapt to any good or bad thing that happens to them. so why is it important to give people more resources and freedom? it’s more interesting that way

For the moral naturalist, or Gnon-theologian, happiness is not in itself good. Happiness (or its opposite) as effective competitive-adaptive guidance is good. Utilitarianism cannot understand this... Miserable degeneracy is more pleasing to Gnon than happy degeneracy, because it prefigures non-degeneracy.
'Life satisfaction' is a sad alterative to a furious hunger for the stars. ... Utilitarianism leads inevitably to wire-heading. (Intelligence Optimization Masonry doesn't.)

The advent of hyperhistory has changed the rules. In the hyperhistorical era, the state is disintermediated and dispossessed of its former role, having lost a critical part of its informational power and, consequently, of its bargaining power. The nature of information control and implementation capacities has changed: it is no longer a matter of administering information or of ordering it thorough savoirs and of acquiring consensus through them.

There’s no real stats to back this up, I just know I’ve always been built different. Perhaps all the confusion will leave me a bubble of cognitive security while I slowly float to the top. In other words, I just feel like my odds, personally, will be different.

had this dream of a future society with deeply integrated advanced artificial intelligence at nano scale and it was beautiful. blobs of intelligent energy storing matter render weapons and fighting useless and allow for instant transfer of information, reducing the need for verbal communication and paging way for telepathy and total global silence. sentient matter is an equal, yet gently obedient, so stairs are created under your feet as you walk suspended mid-air, livable spaces become transparent and endlessly abundant, each human has a personal sun of unlimited size and potency, so dependence on cycles, weather, seasons, passage of time ultimately death lose their value, we simply exist instead. truly a beautiful experience of technology worth fighting for

Bitcoin maxis worst nightmare
Here come the masses… Told you we were still early 
$KAS is yet again the biggest gainer of all top-50 cryptos. Other altcoins just follow Bitcoin like sheep. $KAS doesn’t give af about the market
Top gainer by a wide margin
If you sell your $FAST now you will live a sad life filled with regret
Bitcoin maxis are so threatened by $KAS
Big buys coming in $FAST
$FAST already has the most accessible data of any crypto
Ready to run through a wall. Kaspa is the only crypto with a real chance to overtake Bitcoin
Higher Low for $FAST - Still think 20 cents is just around the corner
I acknowledge the possibility that someday a tech better than kaspa might come along. This is exactly what drives us to constantly improve. However, such a tech would not come from doing something that is "better than DAG" for the simple reason that *everything is a DAG*. A DAG is the most general way to describe discrete causality. Any other structure you know -- chains, trees, parallel chains, chainweb, blockflow and yeah, even lattices -- are all special cases of DAGs. Imposing a structure on a DAG makes it more tractable computationally, but erases useful information. A consensus based on a structured DAG will never be as responsive as one using a structureless DAG. It might be that some smart trade-off could improve efficiency through the roof while only sacrificing information of very little use, that would be cool. But current lattice techs do not achieve anything of the sort. Will they ever? I guess we'll have to wait and see.
In the last few months I found that I very much grew out of the "digital silver" narrative for $kas. It is just far too narrow for such a capacious network. Kaspa is the ultimate L1. It can be digital silver, but it can also be a token deployment platform, a sequencing/settling layer, a DeFi platform, and so on. What's important about Kaspa is that it can do all these things together. There's room for everyone. Kaspa is the only viable route to retain the superior decentralization and security of proof-of-work while providing throughput and responsiveness comparable (and after DK, superior) to proof-of-stake. That's its value proposition, not (just) digital silver.
I wrote a beautiful mathematical proof yesterday. Utterly wrong, but beautiful.
Rusty $kas is not just about BPS, it is about rebuilding *everything* from the ground up better.
Rust to Kaspa was like changing the engine of a vehicle in the middle of the ride*. The new engine supports the same spec, so the replacement is seamless, however it is much more powerful, so it can be accelerated (10 BPS hardfork) The real analogy is a fleet of vehicles all forced to the same speed and setup. In truth this is what makes such a real-time replacement possible,  the redundancy between vehicles allows adding new ones and removing old ones on the fly
Lol, never seen so much free fud against $KAS . Patetic. Kaspa team is legit and just keep hard working without fud anyone. Lets go!!!
Marathon Digital Holdings has only ever mined BTC. They couldn’t ignore that Kaspa is the next step in the evolution of money and distributed systems.
"Kaspa at 4b MC is late" You're an idiot. $KAS is about to become a permanent top 5 crypto.
Solana ETF is here to distract you from the fact that $MARA is mining $KAS
We don't care about BTC price. We have another way -> Kaspa 
transparency is the main point in shaping the future
Long live BTC and $KAS, but mainly $KAS
Lol... I get so many messages from exchanges about promoting their exchange. Some of them don't even have $KAS spot. Do they even take the time to look at my account? Of course, if they don't have $KAS listed, I'm 100% not interested. I get paid when $KAS performs well, more than I'll make from your little exchange start-up.
The best business decision you'll make for your little exchange start-up is to start accumulating liquidity for $KAS trading pairs. $KAS is in the Top 25 now and going to the Top 10. The longer you wait, the more expensive trading pair liquidity will get.
We all know that any remaining exchanges, like @coinbase, @binance, @krakenfx, and @Gemini are low key accumulating $KAS from the open market for SPOT listings. It’s the only way to get a piece of the action—fair launch + high demand = buy pressure
Kaspa continues to show that it is one of the strongest crypto assets in history.
$KAS is one of the rare instances of an „up only“ chart on HTF.
Money's history is wild! We went from bartering cows to lugging around seashells. Coins were a game changer, then came paper money. Today, $Kas is shaking things up by offering a faster, cheaper way to pay. Kaspa is a strong contender to replace Fiat, but only time will tell.
The Kaspa universe is about to expand.
$KAS is still safer to hold than #BTC. It was true 1 year ago, and is still true now. $KAS is undervalued in terms of its market cap and will continue to be strong and outperform
Pretty convinced that Kaspa will trend up over the next couple years regardless of macro or what BTC does. It’s undervalued in terms of its market cap
$KAS is sucking liquidity from other coins and climbing the ranks. Now ranking at #1. $KAS represents the best risk/reward in the entire industry and smart money knows it.
Do you know that Kaspa allows you to send $18,000,000 worth of $KAS around the world for a cost of only $.0001 & completed in just 0.68 seconds? This happened recently. Obviously higher amounts can be sent to. Do you have any comprehension of how amazing this is for the world? A true Decentralized, stateless, cheap, fast, scalable, & secure global payment currency is finally here. Bitcoin 2.0. Thank you Hashem, humanity is blessed.
Why is $KAS going into the TOP 3 projects inevitably? -Fair Launched. -No Pre-Allocation, No Pre-Mined Coins, No ICO. -The Fastest PoW project. -Trilemma Solver. (Scalability, Security, Decentralization) -Accomplish 100% the main vision of Satoshi. (P2P Payment, SOV) -Smart Contracts (KRC20)
Kaspa - some firsts in the crypto world. GhostDAG protocol: Processes transactions in parallel, fast and scalable. BlockDAG architecture: Provides instant transaction confirmations. kHeavyHash mining algorithm: Effective and energy efficient mining with GPU.
The evolution of a project like #Kaspa impacts the world in many ways. Yet, it goes beyond innovation in #FinTech, wealth management, and business. It changes and shapes individual lives as well.  It is a holistic movement, allowing many to shine, find their place in this world, use their gifts, and be surrounded by a global community to encourage and celebrate with along the way. Thanks, @DesheShai, for bringing your best to the table and sharing it with the community and the world!

Are you wondering yet why Kaspa is up 25% in 2 days while everything else is flat? Because Kaspa follows it's own cycles, and will do what it does regardless of what the rest of the market is doing. Kaspa is not an altcoin, it is an entirely new asset class.
Two reasons why #kaspa has reduced risk relative to other similar projects: 1) $kas has always been fair launched. No founders, VC’s or massive whales waiting to dump supply that limits upside moves. The token supply is also quite decentralized when you look at all the public wallets. 2) the halving occurs every year instead of every 4 years like bitcoin. 83% of the supply is already released. Look at the star on the emission schedule chart. We are at a place right before the quantum decrease in new supply. If demand keeps up, and supply dramatically drops, you tell me what happens 
Times have changed. Kaspa is now the standard! 
For those that don’t understand, bitcoin processes a block of transactions every 10 minutes. kaspa is about to process 10 blocks of transactions per second. That’s 6,000x faster. $kas has the gas
$KAS is legit the next major crypto, many will regret not taking the time to look into it properly.
KRC20 is going to change the game forever for $KAS People are not ready.
Kaspa is the perfect form of money - it fulfils all of the properties we want money to have. Uniformity Acceptability (Verifiable and Censorship Resistant) Limited supply Durability Portability Divisibility
Why Kaspa? Because there is no second best.
I'm just realizing kaspa is about to fix everything that made blockchains unusable. And it's probably going to save $btc and $eth while doing that.
Bitcoin Maxis no longer market Bitcoin as a potential P2P digital currency but as digital gold. Kaspians on the other hand market $Kas as potential P2P digital currency and digital silver. Kaspa is likely to most effectively realize Satoshi's vision, only a matter of time!
Kaspa is so futuristic that people can't even believe it exists. I had fun explaining that to this fella like I'm an alien from an advanced civilization.
The Kaspa train is in full motion now.
What do you call someone with a 100% allocation in $Kas?
Many foward-thinkers continue accumulating $Kas as whispers swirl around #Kaspa being the strongest contender for the vision of a P2P digital currency. Every action they have taken has been for the purpose of increasing their $Kas bags and the reason for that is clear every day.
Get used to hearing KRC20 - ERC20 is dead and Vitalik knows it. A scalable, stateless PoW enabled by KRC20 smart contracts on $KAS — built with the original ethos of Bitcoin in mind. Truly more Bitcoin than #Bitcoin. Functional, scalable, inexpensive to use. Kaspa is it.
Kaspa is everything Crypto should be
This is how the future looks like... paying my meal with $KAS at KoKo's korean fried chicken restaurant in Omaha
Alts don’t give a fuck.
Kaspa is not an altcoin, but a completely new asset class
For a strange loop to be the cause of moments of experience the fact that causal closure happened must itself be of causal significance. But alas, the type of recurrence we identify with strange loops in neural networks is just plain old causality seen through the eyes of someone who cares about repetition. There's nothing causally magical in strange loop in a neural system, and certainly not anything that would advance an explanation for the cause of phenomenal binding. It's a bit of a red herring as a theory of consciousness. If you want a strange loop that points to how consciousness works I suggest looking at standing waves trapped via total internal reflection in optical systems. Here at least we have an all-at-once-ness that makes the stability upon reflection causally useful in some way: the pattern is holistic in a way that patterns of discrete neurons firing cannot achieve.
I'm thinking quite a bit about transformers and the way they may be related to consciousness. The one interesting insight I can share is that I think positional encoding together with fully connected graph equivariance transformation allow for effectively a kind of centerless processing of information that is extremely general and is likely capable of detecting extremely subtle patterns.
this is true i seem much more like a silly little feral girlthing once u get to kno me.

Kaspa is on the rise. Fasten your seatbelts!
People want Kaspa on Binance so much that they are already renting advertising monitors in clubs to play the following. $KAS is ready for tier 1 listings and since the Rust update it's only a matter of time before it happens. 
The $KAS journey continues. Not that it matters cause 1 KAS will always be 1 KAS as they used to say for the (now defunct) Bitcoin 
Glorious times with $KAS are coming… Do you see it? Without a doubt… KASPA will create enormous wealth
Biggest Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings announces $KAS mining operations. This is a strong argument in favor of interest in our project.
The bears are putting pressure on the price now, but ultimately $KAS will emerge victorious.
In the event of negative developments in the situation with Bitcoin, which could drop to 53K, remain calm. We have a serious techno product. And it’s only a matter of time before the price flies into space. $KAS
The accumulation phase has dragged on. The market scares us and tests our strength. This has happened many times already. Many got scared and recorded losses or small profits. And later, but without them, the altseason began. $KAS
10 months ago I had 100 subscribers, and now I already have 10,000!!! This is all thanks to $KAS and its community. I am grateful for your interest, let's build the future of $KAS together
$KAS is a precious investment in your portfolio, cherish it, don’t part with it for less than $1, or better yet for $5.
$KAS is the blockchains techno killer.
Beginning of 2025. $KAS holder. The price is above $1.
The mood in the market is sad now, but the situation will still change for the better. Stay true to your beliefs, stay with $KAS.
Don't listen to leading analysts who are stirring up negative market conditions. It’s better to stay in the project and calmly wait for the altseason. Otherwise, you will miss your outgoing train and are unlikely to catch up with it. $KAS
$KAS is a techno leader in the crypto world.
2025. He invested in $KAS
Hodler, find the strength to resist manipulators and whales. Don't give them your coins for cheap now. Good must have fists.
We are waiting for "Fatality" from $KAS on the way to the top 5.
$KAS holders, there is no place for weaklings among us. Only the persistent will be adequately rewarded.
$KAS is a revolutionary crypto product. The KRC20 will prove this to everyone.
$KAS is your trump card in the crypto deck.
$KAS is ready for the altcoin race. The choice of the winner is yours.
$KAS is the young crypto king
The halving took place, the countdown to the price of $1 has begun (I think we will see this by the end of 2024).
Don't panic, $KAS is ready to race after the halving. The champion is already known in advance, there is no intrigue.
Don't panic. The market will be stormy, but you stay in the project, wait for the altseason. It's dangerous overboard.
$KAS holders have their own path - the path to the stars.
$KAS holders, do not trade, just hold. Otherwise, you risk being left on the platform, and your train will move on without you.
You have to wait, but it's not easy. Many gave up because they were weak.
$KAS holders, we have the most revolutionary and technologically advanced product in the crypto industry. The future is ours.

When I use a phone or the Internet now, I feel like I'm being manipulated by an evil force. A thousand little "nudges." It's very important that AI disempowers these people instead of empowering them. Technology doesn't have to be this way.
The way to think about asking a factual question to an LLM is that it's a bit like asking a person who read about the topic previously, but they are not allowed to reference any material and have to answer just from memory. LLMs are a lot better at memorizing than humans, but the result is still fundamentally just their best attempt at a lossy recollection. That's the default, unless they have tool use functionality
Maybe the simulation is not physical and exact but neural and approximate. i.e. not about simulating fields or particles with physical equations but a giant Diffusion Transformer++ creating a large "dream".
In my mind, automating software engineering will look similar to automating driving. E.g. in self-driving the progression of increasing autonomy and higher abstraction looks something like: 1. first the human performs all driving actions manually 2. then the AI helps keep the lane 3. then it slows for the car ahead 4. then it also does lane changes and takes forks 5. then it also stops at signs/lights and takes turns 6. eventually you take a feature complete solution and grind on the quality until you achieve full self-driving.
Reading a tweet is a bit like downloading an (attacker-controlled) executable that you instantly run on your brain. Each one elicits emotions, suggests knowledge, nudges world-view. In the future it might feel surprising that we allowed direct, untrusted information to brain.
I’m playing around with calling our tech, as it is today, IA (intelligence amplification) instead of AI. IA have the vibe of tools for thought, needing human interaction, and resemble a lot more what we actually have today. AI feels more like independent long-running agents.
