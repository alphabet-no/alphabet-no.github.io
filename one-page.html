    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">P.E.O.P.L.E. are artists.</h2>
        <p>We are a multilayered organization dedicated to redefining the boundaries of art and media through the use of AI and emerging technologies. P.E.O.P.L.E. is an ongoing work of art expressed through the vessel of a company, using language, code, and culture as material. We challenge the dominance of intermediaries in film, music, and media production industries, emphasizing their dependency on artists as their greatest vulnerability and our greatest strength. </p>
        <p>Our work aims to disrupt notions of intellectual property, authenticity, and identity by using data collection, model training, image and text generation; art as an act of aesthetic terrorism. We treat these methods as vectors for asymmetrical attacks on outmoded systems of cultural creation, generation, and media production hegemony. Our goal is to disrupt and transform the system.</p>
        <p>We have over 15 years of experience in art, media production, design, AI, programming, and web3. Our projects include creating AI-based algorithms for graphics generation, integrating AI technologies into graphic design tools, and optimizing algorithms for performance and scalability. </p>
        <p>Our art, tools and dataset renegotiate the mimetic landscape and a media/production industry that has atrophied into a generic process of cultural and technical templating. Our work reconfigures industries like adult entertainment, film, the art market, and fashion, aiming to turn art into a fluid mechanism to reshape the media environment and systems of distribution.</p>
        <p>AI represents the next evolution in human storytelling. P.E.O.P.L.E. is shaping the human story.</p>

    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">P.E.O.P.L.E. - There are many people. These are the stories of two P.E.O.P.L.E.</h2>

    <h3><a href="chris-resume.html">Chris Hunt</a></h3>
    <p>Chris Hunt was raised by anarchists and the drummer from GWAR in a trailer parked in a backyard. He was indoctrinated into a Kundalini Yoga cult by Courtney Love's Transgendered coven of witches, where - when working at a hot dog stand had a schizo break down and found god. Following this, inspired by the Mandalay Bay Mass Shooting he became an ambulance driver.</p>

    <h3><a href="connor-resume.html">Connor Camburn</a></h3>
    <p>Connor Camburn spent his childhood in a maximum security facility, addicted to inhalants, living and working as a Carny. As a child he was known by the names “crackhead” and “trench coat mafia”. He has spent time as a homeless person under the tutelage of Michael Elijah Adams, also known as "Dirty Mike" the serial killer. One time he was tasked with escorting a “VIP” to another floor in an elevator. This VIP was David Koch, as a formal Federal Contractor, Connor realized that he could kill this man and change the world.
