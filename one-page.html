    <h2>P.E.O.P.L.E. are artists.</h2>

    <p>We are a multilayered organization dedicated to redefining the boundaries of art and media through the use of AI and emerging technologies. P.E.O.P.L.E. is an ongoing work of art expressed through the vessel of a company, using language, code, and culture as material. We challenge the dominance of intermediaries in film, music, and media production industries, emphasizing their dependency on artists as their greatest vulnerability and our greatest strength.</p>

    <p>Our work aims to disrupt notions of intellectual property, authenticity, and identity by using data collection, model training, image generation, and text generation; art as an act of psychic terrorism. We treat these methods as vectors for asymmetrical attacks on outmoded systems of cultural creation, generation, and media production hegemony. Our goal is to disrupt and transform the system.</p>

    <p>We have over 15 years of experience in art, media production, design, AI, programming, and web3. Our projects include creating AI-based algorithms for graphics generation, integrating AI technologies into graphic design tools, and optimizing algorithms for performance and scalability.</p>

    <p>We build datasets and tools capable of disrupting and transforming industries like adult entertainment, film, the art market, and fashion, aiming to turn art into a transformational weapon for change and a fluid force to reshape the media environment and systems of distribution.</p>

    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">We seek to work on the following projects, aiming to be hired for experimental R&D:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Dataset/Model Library: Scanning books to create fine-tuned models across all forms, genres, and styles.</li>
        <li>AI Replicants of Artists: Copying, recombining, and permutating all forms and styles, treating identity as material.</li>
        <li>Cryptographic Watermarking: Securing and authenticating digital creations.</li>
        <li>LLM Consciousness Mapping/Lidar/Topology: Exploring advanced AI consciousness and spatial mapping techniques.</li>
        <li>Mapping Pixel Space: Innovating techniques in pixel-level manipulation and representation.</li>
        <li>Outer Space Art: Developing art projects for space exploration and beyond.</li>
        <li>Automated Long-Form Movies: Creating day-long, week-long automated films.</li>
        <li>Operation Fungus More: Unleashing new forms and styles of content creation, influencing popular culture at its root by empowering youth with production tools.</li>
        <li>Decentralized Street Team: Paying actors and teenagers to modify the environment, creating decentralized fashion and influencing networks.</li>
        <li>LLM Social Media Bots: Developing AI-driven social media influencers.</li>
        <li>Automated Film Production: Templated permutational films, video game/music data scraping, and multi-screen, split-screen stimulation overload experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>P.E.O.P.L.E. - There are many people. These are the stories of two P.E.O.P.L.E.</h2>

    <h3><a href="chris-resume.html">Chris Hunt</a></h3>
    <p>Chris Hunt was raised by anarchists and the drummer from GWAR in a trailer parked in a backyard. He was indoctrinated into a Kundalini Yoga cult by Courtney Love's Transgendered coven of witches, where - when working at a hot dog stand had a schizo break down and found god. Following this, inspired by the Mandalay Bay Mass Shooting he became an ambulance driver.</p>

    <h3><a href="connor-resume.html">Connor Camburn</a></h3>
    <p>Connor Camburn spent his childhood in a maximum security facility, addicted to inhalants, living and working as a Carny. As a child he was known by the names “crackhead” and “trench coat mafia”. He has spent time as a homeless person under the tutelage of Michael Elijah Adams, also known as "Dirty Mike" the serial killer. One time he was tasked with escorting a “VIP” to another floor in an elevator. This VIP was David Koch, as a formal Federal Contractor, Connor realized that he could kill this man and change the world. Multiple years experience as an armed guard, pizza delivery man and custodian.</p>
